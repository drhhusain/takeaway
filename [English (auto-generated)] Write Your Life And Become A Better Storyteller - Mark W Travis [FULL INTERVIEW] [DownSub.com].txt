well what are the primary reasons that

we tell other people stories about our

lives

what are the primary reasons we tell

people stories about our lives

uh first of all it's varied a lot of

reasons

but the i think the important thing you

have to realize is that you do it

almost every day you will tell

somebody something about your life what

happened to you in the morning

what happened to you yesterday in other

words it's a primary way of connecting

with people is just to tell them

what happened in our lives even if

someone says how are you rather than

saying finds it i'm fine

except the other day this is what

happened and then you have a little bit

of your story

so the reason getting back to your

question the reason we tell people

stories about our lives are

multiple one is to connect

one is to be seen another is to actually

hide you can tell a story from your life

and hide

an aspect of yourself or the truth about

yourself

by telling another story you can tell a

story in your life to avoid

what the conversation is about you can

tell a story in your life to get

attention to feel important

you can tell a story a part of the story

of your life to

actually feel vulnerable and to get

sympathy or empathy

so there's a long wide range of reasons

we

sometimes intuitively instinctively

tell the stories from our life that tell

what's going on

in fact just before this interview i

won't go into them but

all of us the four of us here were

telling stories

about our lives and what we've been

through and what we're doing and all of

that

and we did this happens all the time

but then you have to look at if you are

intentionally

telling a story there's a story you were

going to intentionally tell

to one person to a group of people to

100 people a thousand people

now you have to think about your

question

actually karen why why am i telling

this story now if you want to tell a

story and the story is

fiction you also have to ask yourself

why am i telling this story but at the

same time you're also

making up a story you're creating a

story so there are two aspects

of it why am i telling it which will

affect what the story

is and how i'm going to write it but in

autobiographical stories that doesn't

happen

because there's something unique about

an autobiographical stories like the

ones you and i were discussing earlier

they have already been written

because they have already happened

there's nothing to

create the events you told the events i

told earlier

those have happened now you look at the

story and there is a

few big questions i want to tell this

story

the first thing is you have way more

information than you need you have all

the details of the story whatever the

event

was everything that happened everything

that happened to you around you what

other people did what other people said

whatever that event was there's way more

information

than you probably want to tell or could

include

so it's more now like making a

documentary film you have all this

footage

and you want to extract from that

footage

a smaller story so now you have an event

what am i going to actually tell but

then you have to ask yourself

why am i telling this story and this is

where a lot of people struggle now elsia

and i

when we're teaching our workshop on

autobiographical storytelling called

write your life

one of the big things we deal with will

have anywhere from six

to 15 students each of them has an

autobiographical story that they've

already written just a three minute

story

and it's really interesting that a lot

of them have no idea which is totally

understandable

why they picked that story they picked

the story on their own

we just say pick an event and they are

not clear why and that's fine

there's no problem with that that's very

normal i don't know why so now

part of the struggle is to explore

yourself and explore

your experiences and to learn while

you're working on the story

learn about the story learn about

yourself and eventually learn

why you picked that story and there are

some people we've worked with when they

start to realize

why they really picked that story

sometimes they're horrified

oh i didn't want to do that i didn't

want to reveal that

and all i could say is well you picked

the story

and they realized they did that there's

something

inside going on and my belief is that

with autobiographical storytelling

there's an

inner voice that's even helping you pick

the story

so if you're going to meet with somebody

maybe for a job or a date or whatever

and you want to tell them something

about yourself and say oh i know what

i'll do i'll tell

him or her this story about what

happened to me because it's really a

great story

do you know why you picked that story

are you clear

and this all comes way before

the question of how do you want the

listener to receive the story

what do you want the listener to get

from the story

how do you want the listener to see you

as the storyteller or even to see you

as the person in the story and all of

that

is open and all of that is malleable

even without

changing the story so the question now

becomes

how do i tell the story so that i can

project myself present myself the way i

want to

and how can i tell it so that the

listener will receive the story the way

i want them to receive it do you think

people

change their story and it's not by

maybe just by omission by the way

they're reading the room

maybe they can tell either the room is

welcoming or maybe it's not so welcoming

so they don't feel comfortable sharing

certain aspects of their lives because

they can

there's a there's an elephant in the

room they're not sure what it is

but then they leave out certain details

because they don't want to offend

or or maybe they realize it won't be met

with the same reception as if they were

in another

setting yes now your question karen was

about do they change it

i mean in the process of telling it or

now are you talking about a stage

presentation like a solo show or

something like that or a speech

or a ted talk um it's possible

it's very very very possible it's very

possible

with the most skilled storytellers they

can change it in a heartbeat because

they can

tell a part of the story and get a

reaction that tells them okay i need to

make a

shift i need to make an adjustment and

go in a different direction because

that's

being received negatively or being

misinterpreted

and so i'm going to have to clear that

up and i'll shift sometimes shift to

another story

or tell the story in a different way or

reveal

something different within the story

than i had attended i had intended to

reveal this aspect of my character

or my experience in the story i'm going

to shift that to something else

and they can do it within the telling of

the story

i have one small story not an

autobiographical story but

i was uh working actually with val

kilmer

many years ago on his portrayal of um

mark twain now he's not doing an

autobiographical piece at all but he's

doing mark twain

telling mark twain stories so it's mark

twain telling stories

and we were talking a lot about hal

holbrook who he admired a lot who

has a whole career doing mark twain and

one thing i didn't know that bell told

me was that

mark twain had 17

different shows he could do all

mark twain material that he had

researched and

explored and so much material about mark

twain

that and he would get a booking he would

say okay you're going to do this in

we want to you perform in new york and

based on the fact that it's new york he

would

select certain material you're going to

do in new york for this

organization aha he'd do research on the

organization and from all the wide range

of material he would have

he would construct a different show

specifically for them if he was doing

the south it was a whole different show

so i think the the whole thing of

autobiographical storytelling i think by

instinct when we're just having a

conversation like you and i are

and we're telling the story by instinct

we will change

if we're not getting the reaction we

want we will shift

i know there are times i've started to

tell a story in a group and a

story and it got a little interrupted at

one point and

this happened to me just a few weeks ago

and i went

that's it my story's done i know

there's no point in finishing the story

i could feel that the energy and the

interest of the people with somewhere

else

and there was no point so i just stopped

so you can do that so i think there is

um

that's very important it's a great

question because we are telling our own

stories we're actually revealing

something about ourselves rather than

someone asking me what's your screenplay

about and i tell them that story well

that's not an autobiographical story at

all that's

a fiction story and i'll stick to

whatever the story is and hope that they

like it

but i'm telling an autobiographical

story i'm actually revealing bits and

pieces of me

one little piece after another after

another after another

and i know the times that i've done some

rather long stories

totally improvised long autobiographical

stories

about my experiences in hollywood and

things like that

and it's been a speech that i've agreed

to do i

will shift and change the tone of it

even based on the reactions and

sometimes the reaction is i'll say

something and i hear a reaction that i

wasn't expecting which means

they know exactly what i'm saying this

is a you know it's an inside joke they

got it okay then i will keep going in

that direction

because that is supporting what i want

to reveal

do you think they are regional

autobiographical stories

so let's say someone in la may tell

an autobiographical story that's more

career-based

whereas in some small town in another

part of the u.s

it might be more about their family and

how long their families

had the land or something i don't know

i'm just generalizing here but

i was wondering is is autobiograph

autobiographical storytelling more

regional based

in total in terms of the people who act

now you're talking about who are doing

it more or less professionally

you mean um i guess in what we select to

reveal

or leave out well again i'm going to

take your two example you have the la

story which you said is career-based or

industry-based or whatever

and somewhere in the midwest it's more

about family

my belief is and i'm pretty sure i might

the audience in la would rather hear the

family story

the audience in the midwest would rather

hear the the industry story

in other words because the the

to do a story a lot of stories about the

industry in l.a we go

i've heard that i've heard i lived that

you know that's nothing new but for

someone to be telling about being raised

in arkansas

you know and working on a farm like i

want to hear that because that

is not part of my experience i want that

experience i want to learn from that

so again that's judging the audience

assessing the audience and

will what i am talking about

resonate with them in some way or will

it

offend them in some way if you do a

one-person show in l.a about the

struggles of becoming a

famous actress most people won't go

i think we i know that we know that

story

we've heard that story so many times

well judy

the movie judy though because you're

seeing another side of it which is

another side the happy-go-lucky side of

what

most people probably want to project

yeah they'll go for that one

you know but i think that's because that

person's revealing you know renee

zellweger's character was

she was revealing these demons that we

don't always get

yeah and she's revealing the demons

within a very famous icon that we know

and so we want to know more and you're

right that film shows us

more about who judy really was and less

actually less about her career i mean

her career was in there

but it's more about the demons she was

struggling with

which is fascinating she did an

excellent job yeah

what makes a great story what makes a

great story

you know karen

that question is huge that's what drives

this entire industry

is what makes a great story i think a

couple of things

for me and it has to be personal because

i think different people have different

opinions of what is a great story or a

great film or whatever

but the great story is a story about a

very ordinary

human being who's faced with

extraordinary challenges

and goes through an extraordinary

transformation

trying to survive or get back to where

they were

or to find their way to some new place

so there's a journey

there's a great journey that that person

personally goes on

to me that that's what makes a great

story great story

to me is a story about relationships

about the struggle

uh this is obviously very personal

because this is my preference

the struggle in relationships not just

the struggle of the two individuals or

three or four individuals and trying to

achieve what they want to achieve

but the struggle we all have as human

beings just relating to

each other and being open with each

other being honest with each other

getting what we want from each other

giving what we want to each other

forming

some kind of relationship and how

difficult that is how perilous it is

how fragile it is and how quickly it can

fall apart

a good example of that is marriage story

which is not

which is like a beautiful wonderful

happy marriage which is falling apart

and sometimes at least my experience

watching that film

i'm going why why is it falling apart

well because it's that fragile and i

think that you know

there wasn't a big violation in the

middle of it that created this

falling apart those kind of stories

are what make for me

make great stories then in the story

telling the telling of the story

what makes a great story is when i'm

surprised

i love it when i'm surprised when

there's a point where the story's going

on

and what we all do when we see

a story happening is we all in our minds

consciously or unconsciously

anticipate or predict where it's going

to go

i can see where this is going to go or

this is going to happen or

because he did that she's going to do oh

i can see it and

many times we're right but then there

are those moments when it just does a

total reversal and we didn't see it

coming we didn't see it coming and what

that does

those moments those turning points that

are so startling

understandable but startlingly just are

not expected

and then they're not magical it's not

science fiction or anything like that

it's just not expected

that moment opens up something for us

and where we can see

deeper into who those characters really

are so we get greater insight into these

characters and their struggles and their

problems

and that's the beauty of a well told

story

why do you think some people resonate

with one story over another

so someone could see what we sound like

we both saw judy we both liked it

i thought it was was excellent as tragic

as it was

but some other people could see it and

say

i'm not impressed why do you think one

person thinks a story is great versus

another season says nothing special i

think it all comes to

and else and i have had this a couple of

times so i will sit

side by side at a movie and

elsa who's right over here elsa

will love the movie and i don't or vice

versa

now it's only because we're two

different people that it doesn't

it's still the same it's still the same

movie still the same story but getting

back to your question why what makes why

do people

resonate with certain stories i think it

all comes down to

projection because as we're watching a

story

one thing i'm very keenly aware of for

myself and for everybody else when we

watch a story we project ourselves into

the other characters

in fact and we do it when we read a

script or read a novel

we do the same thing but when we watch a

movie we do the same we project

ourselves and the way we

participate in the portrayal of that

character we get

involved with that character we care we

have empathy or we have disgust we have

some kind of

emotional connection with each character

and so we

go on the journey with them now if we

watch a movie like judy

and someone watches that and there's no

way for that

individual who's watching it to project

himself or herself into that character

because there's no common ground

there's nothing not that you have to be

an actress or a singer or in hollywood

but do you aspire to do anything

artistic do you have

you know these demons that is there

anything within

if there's nothing within that character

that they can project themselves into

and attach themselves to

then they're not going to like the film

because it

is not speaking to them nothing wrong

with the film

it just doesn't speak to them and they

could like another film

like a transformer film which they think

is brilliant and i could go

i don't get it because that i can't

project myself

into that world so there's a world and

there are characters that we have to

project

ourselves into and get involved and

engaged with

and if we can't then we'll just sit back

and watch the movie

and wonder what the whole fuss is all

about

you are now working on something called

the travis technique for

autobiographical storytelling

the travis technique for

autobiographical storytelling

yes that's a long title what is it about

what is it about well it's um it's about

autobiographical storytelling

obviously and where it comes from

i have to go back and give you a little

history of this because

you made it sound like we're just

starting this this has been going on for

about 30 years

and about 30 years ago through

circumstance i got involved with helping

develop

and directing a one-person show with

paul

link which became time flies when you're

alive

that story which became a stage play

was the story of paul's wife who got

breast cancer and eventually died from

breast cancer and it was the story of

that whole journey that he went on with

his wife and his children

while she was fighting breast cancer and

without going into more detail

because there's a lot of detail though

it's a very powerful story it's a very

powerful love story it's a

it's a very sad story it's a very tragic

story it's a very heroic story

and paul was a friend of mine and i knew

francesca and when he said he wanted to

write a play because he and i and

another friend of ours dennis redfield

had created several plays together that

we had done

he said he wanted to create a play about

their life together and her death

at home because she refused to go to

hospitals and stuff like that

and i remember saying to her this was

only a week after she died i remember

saying to him

fine okay but let's talk about it later

let's talk about it after the memorial

service the memorial service for

francesca was going to be in a few days

it was actually at john ritter's home in

brentwood we were all there it was a

beautiful

out on the back lawn you could see the

mountains

and a lot of white balloons you can

imagine the white piano people played

music people read poetry it's very sad

but it's all this tribute to francesca

and then paul

was going to speak last and paul with

their one-year-old child she had a child

while she was fighting cancer

which is a big part of the story but

that rosie that one-year-old child

in his arm he got up and started to talk

and he's the first thing he says is i

want to tell you about my best friend

and within a few minutes he had

everybody there laughing

as he was telling this story and i'm

watching him and i'm going oh my god

this is amazing

and afterwards i talked to him and i

said paul

we're going to do the play but not the

play you thought you were going to do

he said what do you mean i said we're

not going to do this play of all these

characters

i said it has to be a one-man show it

has to be just

you telling your story i wanted to take

what i had seen there

and put that essence of paul and his

vulnerability and his openness and his

honesty and his transparency

on stage because i said that's the only

way this is going to work

we worked on it for about a year we did

a lot of research

we even talked to spaulding gray we're

doing a lot of things i've developed

this is the first time i'd ever done

this

after that was done i said to myself

and it was very successful ran for a

year in los angeles sold out

at the tiffany theater it was a sort of

a weird situation

but i said i'm done

i said i i can't do this again it's

exhausting

working on one with one person on one

show but it was it was a beautiful

experience

until i was at an acting class and i

heard another monologue

this man got up and he told a story

about

when his mother he did this monologue

about from some play

i thought about his mother picking up

after school taking him 350 miles away

from their hometown putting him in a

motel

and leaving him there at the age of 10

for the summer and he told the story and

i went oh my god i said afterwards i

said shane where you know where'd that

story come from i mean

what what's that from it's amazing

because i thought it was from a script

he said that's from my life

and i remember that feeling at that

moment going

oh my god i've got another one now this

kept happening i kept getting

people would start coming to me and we

did that that show which was called no

place like home which was all about

child abuse that's why she took

him there to save him from her the

father

who was intent on killing the son

she saved his life so

that was a whole show about child abuse

and then came a bronx tale which i

developed with

chaz palm and terry and that became so

suddenly all these

shows became big hits and people said

coming to me but it wasn't

the fact that people were coming to me

what

my tendency i have to tell you a little

story

when i was a young boy i was very good

at fixing things

taking things apart and fixing things i

loved doing that

and my father had an old watch

a pocket watch which didn't work and i

asked him if i could take it up it

wasn't valuable

at all and i asked him if i could take

it apart he said sure

so i took the whole thing apart and put

because i was

curious to figure out how it worked and

i got it all back together again it

still didn't work but it was all back

together again

the reason i tell you that is this is

the way my mind works

i'm less interested in the final product

of what i create

than i am and how it's created

so i did a lot of research while i was

developing all these one-person shows on

what how does this process really work

what are the techniques that work why

did this work in this

with this show and not with this show or

why all of these things

and from that long period of time which

started back in the early 90s

a long period of time up until to now

we're still doing this

exploring this whole aspect of

autobiographical storytelling

why is it so powerful and what are all

the tools and the techniques that you

can use in the telling of any story

that will change and alter and enhance

or mold the story in the way you want to

so that has led to but again back in the

90s someone asked me to teach a workshop

on what i was doing this is

after i'd had several very successful

shows

and i said i couldn't i said i can't i

said it's just one on one i work with

the actor

we worked together we developed the show

that's it

and then that person did something which

is

totally unforgivable offered me a lot of

money to teach the workshop

and i went no now maybe i can do it so i

agreed to do it and i started a workshop

and that's when i started to realize i

can teach this

there is a lot of stuff i do know and so

this has become

now this workshop which at that time was

called the solo workshop because it was

mostly for solo performers

now it has morphed into being called the

write your life workshop because it's

not

for solo i mean it's for everybody it's

for solo performers

for writers memoirists screenwriters any

any storyteller so we have storytellers

from all over the world

who want to take this workshop

because it's so powerful not because

they want

interesting not because they want to

learn how to

tell autobiographical stories they want

to

learn the basics and the sort of the

core and the foundation of storytelling

because when when like screenwriters

take this

course they suddenly their screenwriting

improves

so it's a foundation so when it says the

travis technique for autobiographical

storytelling

this right to life is the foundation of

everything else and i teach

not just the writing but the directing

and acting and working with that it all

comes out of that so when people come to

study with us

the first thing they do is

write autobiographical story and go

through that process

it's like learning the scales before you

start to try to play

classical music or something else

what if someone says well i'm not a

writer and i'm not

i'm not planning on doing a one-woman

show

why would i need to to learn how to tell

my own story

where are opportunities that we have

this in our daily lives we don't even

realize it

in our daily lives now i'm assuming this

person that you're

throwing at me uh is a writer or just

just just an

average maybe they're an insurance

adjuster oh insurance address and and

they say

what do i convince me why should i take

a class to learn how to tell my personal

story

and i would go back this is going back

to some of our first questions some of

your first questions i would say to that

person okay

um you're an insurance adjuster you're

working with people and clients and

all the time yeah when's the last time

you told one of them

a personal story

when's all that and why were you telling

that story

and did you get the res the

result that you wanted did you

communicate what you really

wanted to and were you even aware of

what you were trying to communicate

and if you were aware of what you're

trying to communicate do you know there

were probably

several a dozen different ways you could

have told that story

to get the result you wanted

in other words i'm just saying that in

your work and your life

you frequently tell a personal story

you go to a family reunion and suddenly

people are telling stories and you have

a story to tell

do you want to tell it consciously or

unconsciously

do you want to be aware mindful of what

you're doing and how you want to

impact other people how you want to be

seen

what you want them to think

so the interesting thing about

storytelling

people people say well i'm a storyteller

i'm a screenwriter i'm a storyteller i'm

a storyteller

who isn't who doesn't

tell stories my

serious belief with the children before

they can speak

all that little those little noises

they're making

they're telling a story in their mind

they're telling a story

they are communicating something

eventually they get language and

eventually they get words and then

stories come out

so even if you if you have a little

three-year-olds or four-year-olds

who can be very verbal two-year-olds can

be very just listen to them their

stories just

start tumbling out of them

it's a huge part of who we are

in fact i think you know storytelling is

right up there with breathing

we do it all the time unconsciously we

need it

on i'm not even knowing why we don't get

go through the day

re reminding ourselves to breathe we

just

do it we don't go through say oh i think

i should tell a story we just

do it and then there's another part of

like write your life

which is very important which is do you

know how to listen to a story

do you know how to hear a story and so

when someone's telling you a story

can you listen listen for the story and

listen for what's really going on can

you see beyond

what they're really saying to see deeper

into the story so there's that

that aspect of it too so that insurance

sales person could benefit enormously

what if someone says well how can i tell

people about myself but i don't want to

tell them certain things

then don't tell them those certain

things in fact don't pick those stories

pick it pick a different story um

yeah there are a lot of people who are

afraid to tell stories because they were

afraid of what they're going to reveal

but then this is a a big aspect a part

of the write your life

process is we ask we don't ask for the

answers to this question

we ask everybody like i could ask you

karen

right go ahead um

if you had no fear okay

if there was no fear what story would

you tell

right now on camera

you can say it on camera it's your

camera

if there was no fear right

i know a few you know a few okay

absolutely

yeah even even that you know in the

workshop even that even

people in the workshop thinking about

the important thing of that question is

not the story you come up with important

about that question is the realization

that

my fear of that story is what's stopping

me

the fear is the important part not the

story

true and then this has happened many

many times in the workshops

one little thing about the write your

life workshop

which i'm very proud i was back in 2001

i was asked to teach it in hawaii

and i taught a weekend workshop there

and then eventually became two weekends

because it became so popular two

consecutive weekends this is where i met

elsa

because she would she was a student back

in 2002

but and that workshop went on for 16

years

up until 2015. anyway i went on for 16

years

and the thing is there were times when

we would bring up like

you know if you had no fear what story

would you tell

and people go oh yeah now a lot of

people who took the workshop

would take it every year which was great

they would come back every year because

they

not because again getting back to your

other question not because they're going

to do a one one-person show

not because they're going to write the

stories they did it because they like

the process of exploring themselves

through these their stories and hearing

their friends

explore themselves and expose themselves

through their stories

and many times we would bring up that

question if you had no fear what would

you

what story would you tell and people go

yeah i know and we ask them to write it

down they write it down we don't ask

them to share it

and many times two or three years later

someone would tell a story

they would say that was the story i

wrote down years ago

that i was afraid to tell and we go wow

something happens now this is a very

important part of autobiographical

storytelling in

one show that i did this is where it

became really clear this is the one on

child abuse

and shane mccabe who is brilliant

performer

told me this story a little story within

the big story

and the little story was about him

living in his

bedroom where he was forced to sleep in

the closet

and because his his house was built by

his father and

it wasn't built that well there were a

lot of openings and places and he's in

the closet and this little squirrel

showed up in the closet and over a long

period of

weeks and weeks and weeks he started to

develop

a relationship with this squirrel

okay and it's a beautiful story and how

the squirrel will adventure eat out of

his hands and how the squirrel when

he could get sneak out of the closet and

sleep in the bed the squirrel would

sleep with him wherever

they would sleep together now it has a

very tragic ending which i'm not going

to tell you

horrible ending but as shane

is telling me this story he said mark

i'm going to tell you a story but

it's not going in the show

he says i want to tell you the story

about chipper because he kept mentioning

chipper and i didn't know who chipper

was so he tells me about chipper the

squirrel

this horrendous story now me

being a storyteller and me being a

director i hear that story go oh this is

good

this has to go in the show and he's

going it's not going in the show i'm not

going to tell that story

and i could see why because he was so

devastated

he could barely hold himself together

while he was telling it and you don't

want that

on stage and he doesn't want that and we

kept working on the show

developing and developing every once in

a while chipper would come up i would

mention chipper he wouldn't mention

chipper

and then one day he said to me

maybe the chipper's story should go in

the show i said really

i said and i would ask him to tell me

again and he would tell me the story

again

and then we tried we said okay let's put

it in there we'll rehearse it we'll try

it and we did

and he kept telling it and telling it

telling it the key thing was i remember

on

opening night we're at the tiffany

theater in los angeles

he's opening in front of 100 strangers

and he's

on stage telling that story and he's

fine he's totally he has it all under

control

and what became clear to me was these

stories that are so traumatic

and so awful that we are so afraid if we

tell them probably afraid that we're

going to die

we'll never recover we'll lose all

self-esteem

or whatever whatever's going to happen

it's just going to be

horrendous or people are going to find

out about it

and and i can't live with that whatever

the fears

are if you keep telling the story

and this is my way of looking at it it's

not that the fears go away

but the power shifts as a ship the story

is here

and you're here this story has power

over you

and it keeps and it keeps it suppressed

but if you keep telling the story

what happens is it shifts and eventually

you have power over the story same story

same dramatic intent same trauma

everything but you have power over the

story

and elsa and i have seen this so many

times when people have

suddenly found somewhere the courage or

the strength to tell something that they

thought they could

never tell and so this process

is also a healing process not intended

not designed to do that but it doesn't

how does knowing our own story make us a

better storyteller

that's a big question that's a great

question because that's at the core

of everything let's say karen you have

an

autobiographical story a story you want

to tell

and a couple of things a couple of

things are very clear

one thing i mentioned earlier is it's

already written

so the question is how to tell the story

not what the story is but how do i tell

it

another thing that's very very clear

getting in terms of writing and getting

in terms

of how this process will

influence your writing of anything

is the protagonist the protagonist

in your story is you and let's say it's

a story when you were 15 years old and

a date you had or something like that

whatever it is i can see you

trying to remember one yeah which one

which was sitting

alone waiting by the phone that's what

it was okay okay it's a story of you

sitting home and

that's fine now you but you're the

protagonist of the story

of any story now the question is when

you think about we talk to writers about

the stories that they're creating and

writing

how well do they know the protagonist

now this is often a

problem um with a lot of the people who

teach

screenwriting or storytelling you know

how well do you know the protagonist how

well do you even know

your own characters but now we're back

to autobiographical

the protagonist is you you should know

you pretty well in fact you should know

the other people around you family and

friends or whoever

else is in that story pretty well this

is good

this is really good but the question is

your protagonist

how well let's say at 15 how well

do you know the 15 year old karen

how well do you know what she was really

thinking really feeling really wanting

really desiring really expecting really

fearing

at that time you know what you did you

know about sitting at the phone you know

that the phone didn't ring or it did

ring and it wasn't wasn't for you it was

for somebody else or whatever it was

you know what the you know what the

events of the story are

but here's something that's really

important

the events of your story karen about

sitting home

waiting by the phone those events and

what happened

is not the story

those are the events of the story that's

the plot

or that's the story line but it's not

the story

the story is what happens inside 15 year

old karen

what is going on inside this young woman

sitting there by the phone what is

really going on

what is she hoping for what is she

fearing who is she fearing that might

call

who is she hoping that might come that's

what we need to know

that's the story so the story exists

inside the protagonist

not around the protagonist now all the

events around the protagonists that

happen

actually trigger what's going on inside

or what's going on inside is a reaction

to

what's going on in the outside so we

need both but the events

are not the story the inner world

of 15 year old karen that is the story

so now in this process and now right now

on camera i'm going to invite you to

come take you and david to come take a

right your life

workshop as our guest see that's on tape

so right now the process is karen

you have to look at 15 year old karen as

a character and go

who is she what's really going on

and then once you can determine i know

what was going on i remember this is

what was going on this was going on

now and you have all of that that was

going on during this

event now the next question is

how do i relate that to the audience

how do i let the audience know that

there's that one guy

charlie and i'm hoping he won't call

because he did threaten to call

i'm hoping because if he calls and i

answer the phone i'm

in trouble because i don't know if i

have the courage to say no to him

and i don't want i'm just making this up

how are you going to let the

audience know that because if the

audience doesn't know that

if the audience in fact doesn't know

what's going on inside you

they don't get the story all they get is

events they go fine you're sitting at

home and then you're worried and

you can say i was worried and all that

which gets us to the two narrators in a

second

here but but that's so learning how to

for the writers to go through the

process of exploring

excavating pulling apart looking at all

the elements of a story that they know

better than anybody else and exploring

really what was going on for them and

for all the people around them and then

to try to understand the other parent

the parents

the brothers and sisters or whoever the

other characters are understanding

them and how can i render them true to

who they are

that's what makes a difference in all

the other writing

because we say what else and i say to

people who have taken the rights your

life

especially writers and directors we say

okay now

you see how deeply you have gone into

your character and all the other

characters they go yeah yeah

you have to do that for every character

and everything you direct

and everything you write that's what you

have to do

and now the bar is really high but now

they understand

i have to understand my protagonist in

my fictional movie as well as i

understand me

but you can't do that until you've gone

through a process of understanding you

well you just triggered a memory and

that was i wasn't 15

but the age 15 came up and that was

being home

and there was a knock at the apartment

door my mom wasn't home i wasn't 15 i

was younger

and it was quote the paper boy coming to

collect

and i said well uh and i was stammering

he goes

if you're 15 i'll take you out

and i remember thinking wow like

like that's he doesn't even know who i

am on the other side i could see him

because

yeah but but it was i can still see that

because it was i don't think i was even

12 yet and he didn't know that

i sounded older than i was but just the

fact that somebody's coming to collect

for the paper

and he's already trying to like you know

hustle up a date or something it's just

kind of funny but so you reminded me of

that because he mentioned

if you're 15 because he said i'm 15. 15

if you're 15 i'll take you out even

though i can't see you

right and i'm here just to climb paper

boy i'm here to collect for your

for your paper but anyway but so so

going into that just reminds me so there

you go there's part of a story

no that's a good story it's a good story

and

on the surface like many most stories

we go oh that's cute it's kind of creepy

at the time yeah

no yeah but it was creepy to you right

right

to the rest of the world you say you

know there i am and he says you're 15

i'll take it oh my god

okay what we do once we start to hear

what's going on inside you

you know that feeling like oh it's this

you know i'm feeling uncomfortable or

that's what we want to hear that's what

that's the

richness that's the core of that's the

gold of the story

is what's going on inside that little 12

year old

right at that moment who's home alone

who's home alone and the paper boy

is is coming to collect yep

it's a great story thank you i can still

see it

what do you think most people go wrong

in telling their personal stories

too much information too little um

too much information or too little

possibly each but

um getting back to what we were talking

about

is yeah there could be too much

information

which about the events and all of that

which actually masks what's really going

on in the character

or they could be too little information

about

the character here's but here's the um

a real key many times when we're doing

these workshops or working with somebody

who's doing this kind of writing

um i will say quite honestly to them

it's a great story but you're not in it

and they'll go what do you mean no no i

was there and i told you i said no no

you were there you were the observer

the way you told the story you were the

observer

more like a journalist you were the

observer and you told us

all the details and you gave us a little

indication like oh yeah in that moment

when i was really scared or something

like that and i go okay

but the thing is you are not really in

the story you have kept yourself

out of the story now this story that

this person has told

quite possibly could be a very traumatic

story

frightening one of those stories that

generates a lot of fear

and now what can happen as a result of

telling a story like that

is as you're telling the story even

keeping yourself

some very much out of the story all

those fears will come back because there

you're

it's it's wired into your system

those fears and everything are in your

body and you are stimulating them again

and so you will feel the fear or feel

the joy

feel the confusion whatever as you're

telling the story

the problem is you will think that the

audience is feeling the same thing

and i can tell you right now they're not

they're not there's no reason for them

because they're not you

they will each member of the audience

will be feeling whatever they feel

they say oh that that's funny oh that's

that's kind of sad

there's a wide range of what they could

be feeling

i think autobiographical the goal of

autobiographical storytelling is can i

tell you a story

can i tell you a story like about my

10th birthday

in such a way that i can take you

through the story

and you are moment by moment feeling

and experiencing exactly what i felt as

the 10 year old at that moment

while the story is being told without

telling you oh in that moment i felt

really scared

then you now that's just a piece of

information that will not stimulate a

feeling within you my job as the

storyteller is to stimulate emotion

within you

not just give you information so this

when you ask about too much information

too

little information it's usually too

little of the

real meat that we want which is what is

going on inside the character i want to

know what you're thinking or feeling

most people won't do that they just want

by instinct they won't do that

it's sort of a preservation instinct so

then we will listen to the story and

we'll have our

own reaction to it

based on our life experience that's it

which

we got to which we talked about with why

people like certain films and certain

stories

now you could tell a story to a group of

a dozen people

without having yourself really present

in the story

and those dozen people will have about a

dozen different reactions to the story

based on

their life experience as if if this had

happened to them

this is how they would respond but the

more powerful story is they

know exactly how you were feeling how

you were responding

and now they're not responding to just

the story

they're responding to your experience

your emotional experience through the

story and that's much more powerful

was there a story that had power over

you

that then you were able to tell so many

times and then you switched it and now

you had power over that story that was

your story

well you know in the 30 years of doing

this

is that what you mean whenever yeah

yes i mean i've been doing this for 30

years

and one um it's a great question karen

and

one thing i realized very early on when

i started to

work either with individual performers

doing solo shows

or work with a group like a workshop or

even a larger group

what i was asking all of those writers

or those artists or those human beings

those people

to do was dig into their past

have a story and start to really explore

it in a very open

raw vulnerable way and in order to

really ask them to

take those that leap

the best way i could um help them do

that was to tell my own stories

so i would always in every workshop tell

a story

or be or tell several stories to give

them examples not only of how the story

works or how the storytelling techniques

which i was trying to teach them work

but it's that simple thing

and this has to do with directing don't

ask an actor to do something that you're

not willing to do yourself

so i couldn't ask these people to write

something that i wasn't willing to do so

i need to do it

and do it in front of them and many

times during that

i would

[Music]

purposely set myself a high challenge

just in terms of the story that i would

pick

or the what i was going to talk about i

would push myself

to say can i go a little bit further can

i go a lit

can i get into a more dangerous area

and there was one time and elsa was

there that i told the story

in hawaii that it happened just two

weeks earlier

which was devastating to me it was a

devastating story

and it was humiliating and brought a lot

of shame

to me and embarrassment and i'd only

told one person about it my sister who

was also in the workshop at that time

and but basically i was hiding it from

the rest of the world and then i decided

in that workshop i was going to tell a

part of that story

and i did and it was a struggle it was

hard

but it was liberating and um

so yes that's you know i've had that

experience many times

going wow now i've done that i can i can

do it again so that

my assessment that telling tough stories

traumatic stories embarrassing or

shameful stories

again and again and again the balance

will change

i've also experienced that within my own

storytelling

have you seen or some people have

they're just

unabashedly open about everything i mean

they're just people that

i'm just shocked they would put

something on twitter but that's just who

they are

as human beings there's no shame in

anything everything's an open book

maybe they came from a family that's

like that and so that's how they

communicated

whereas there's other people that

they're afraid to tell you what they had

for breakfast

right and they're super reserved and you

feel like

every question you ask even about the

weather is somehow a personal intrusion

do you see those people interacting at

your workshop together and just

just you know the ones with the arms

cross where it's not even that they

they don't like somebody but there's

just that's

who they are they're just maybe not as

trusting and other people that

they'll tell the cashier at the store

some intimate detail from their love

life yeah i mean the thing is in the

workshops we get

a whole range of people and it's

interesting because they

they just using your two examples the

one who is just

the ones who just will blurt out

anything personal

and the other ones who are much more

reserved and are afraid to even tell you

their birthday or whatever whatever it

is

we get that range definitely that range

the first thing that's really

interesting is

at the beginning of the workshop what we

do is we check in with each person

in front of everybody not not privately

why they're there

what they what they really want and just

sometimes hearing

what they want is interesting and very

quickly we get a sense of the

personality

and maybe elsa and i have talked to this

person beforehand or met them

online or something so we have a sense

of who they are before they

come into the workshop but we we check

in with them to see

what their goals are and we get a sense

that this one is very

reserved and this let's say this woman

is so reserved and as you said sort of

like that that's not going to talk about

anything and

we just say well i know why she's here

and but then we have a feeling this is

gonna this workshop is gonna be

tough for her or a shock for her and

sometimes

that person will by the end of the three

days

because it's just a three-day workshop

will explode

and something will come out and

sometimes my feeling

is they're there unconsciously because

they want to release

now on the other end the ones who will

expl um

say everything expose everything we have

to watch them carefully too

because they can take over we have

people who come in

and want to show us how it's done

and we know they're going to run into a

shock but when we start

talking to them about some of the things

i've talked to you about they go what

do you mean i don't know myself and

there's another part of this which we

can talk you and i can talk about today

about

how we use interrogation in this process

but because we interrogate that person

if i were to interrogate you

as the 12 year old the one that answered

the door for one picture of the door

so this woman over here is telling a

story about herself and whatever and

then we interrogate her at that time

now suddenly she's aware that she has

she's

not as free as she thought she was

then there's and that person will go

most likely go through a change during

the three days

and there's another huge part of this

workshop

is that it's a workshop there are maybe

a dozen people there

and every single person is working on an

autobiographical story

every single person is struggling with

their own obstacles their own

resistance their own self-esteem

whatever it is they're struggling with

this so you're in a room

that is really rather unique the energy

in the room is extraordinary

so that shy one who won't say anything

is being encouraged by the ones others

that she sees

who are struggling who make

breakthroughs

the the one who thinks she knows and

everything is also going to benefit by

experiencing what the other ones are

going through

so that's a big part of the workshop is

just to be in that environment

for those three days and be immersed

in that world of autobiographical

storytelling and struggling with your

own story

writing your story rewriting your story

listening to other people seeing them

make breakthroughs

seeing them not make breakthroughs and

not be able to get through an obstacle

and seeing how frightening that is

all of that impacts everybody so the

truth is when else and i do these

workshops

we have no idea what's going to happen

we do the workshop pretty much the same

way every time

but then after it's all over elsa and i

sit down and discuss could we

improve how can we change what new

things can we try and we come up with

some new

things but pretty much generally it's

the same thing it's the environment that

the people are plunged into

that causes the change interesting so

the extrovert that is is a

free spirit and tells everybody

everything can learn from the reserved

introverted arms crossed and vice versa

yes

yes and the extrovert may learn very

graphically or just very subtly

that her explosion of stories that she

puts out is actually covering up

the story she's not revealing

anything except an ego

is it a defense mechanism though right

could be

i'm just saying could be i don't know it

depends on the person

but i'm going to tell you this and i'm

going to tell you that and do you

remember the the

the film american beauty yes remember

angela

the the little cheerleader oh yes who

was just talking about her sexual

exploits forever and ever and ever and

ever and ever

until the end when she said this is my

first well that was a cover-up

those stories the stories she was

telling was a cover-up for her

insecurities that she

is as she said ordinary she was afraid

of just being ordinary that nobody would

want her

so she creates this whole myth about

everybody wants her

right in wes bentley who is a drug

dealer i guess in the uh

kind of almost downplays his

intelligence

in a way and you don't realize how deep

and like feeling

he is but i don't know it's been a while

since i've seen it but i love it

yeah so i mean that's just an example so

yeah the extrovert

and the introvert will learn from other

and they and the

the extent of what they learn may not

resonate within them until weeks or

months later

because of this experience they may

start to see things differently they may

start to tell their stories differently

who knows

it's very powerful and it it is a

healing process

and the first workshops i did in hawaii

the first few years

there was a married couple um i think it

was mary and john i think that's that's

their name

anyway and they took it for several

years very couple

they were very unique only in one way

they would each have their story they

were going to tell and as

we learned quickly after the first year

or so

that john would start telling the story

and the thing was watch

mary because mary has probably never

heard this story before

they would each tell stories in the

workshop that they had never

told each other before and by the end of

several years the last time i saw them

they said that workshop

made such a difference in their marriage

you know because it gave them a safe

place to be more open and

more available and more transparent

how does someone decide where to start

their story

wow that's how does where to start the

story

now i'm assuming we have this little

three or four or five minute story

right so a little i'm staying with us

you mean where to start that story

well if they're going to tell people

their life

what if they don't want to say well at

all you know i was raised in such and

such a town

what if they want to start it from the

time that they left college

okay because they feel like that's when

they're real self-beginners

okay we need we need to talk about two

things then now i understand more

we need to un talk about uh sequencing

okay sequencing of information which i

can talk about

which has to do with the events in a

story

and do you really want to start with the

beginning of the story do you want to

start with something in the middle in

other words playing with the sequence

the chronology of events

as you tell the story so that's one

thing the the other thing we can talk

about when you say

tell the story of my life

there's another topic and which i'm

willing to

forget what we're shooting now but

another topic which is about

how an autobiographical story is

put together because it's put together

differently than a screenplay

it's put together differently than

novels put that together differently

than

fiction and how we

the process i use to explore what the

story is really about

through the writing and don't make a

determination at the beginning

so those are two types that make sense

so sequencing

and then sequencing and then structuring

the autobiographical story okay

which are two different things the

structuring is which story

comes first and the sequence of stories

and then there's the sequencing within a

story

so is that something you would determine

if someone presents you

i'm sorry i'm not it presents me what

so when you work with someone how do

they decide

where to begin okay let's talk about how

to where to begin with just

one little story someone has told

a story and i'm not i'm just going to go

back to your

you know can we my life is very dull

yeah i'm not really interested in

talking about me sorry

why don't we do a hypothetical uh

version of karen who's much more

exciting

a hypothetical that's fiction that's

fiction

okay karen who's had an amazing

wild incredible life okay i'm going to

tell you a quick story right now

one of my stories and we'll use that we

will use that as an example

okay and i'll tell you just just give

you an overview of the story

this is when i was uh nine years old

about to become

10 years old and so i was about to have

my 10th birthday i have an older brother

an older sister and i have younger

siblings too

but my parents always made the 10th

birthday a special birthday special gift

extraordinary so as i'm approaching as i

was approaching

my 10th birthday i was very excited

about

what's my gift going to be i had seen

what my older brother peter got it was

great at least he thought it was great

but it was great and it was very

expensive

and i saw what my sister got she thought

it was great they were very happy and so

i wanted something that was equally as

great or

actually better i thought mine should be

better

and so i was waiting for that

moment and then comes the morning of my

birthday

and i'm waking up i can barely sleep i'm

waking up i can't wait

until the we get to the the time of the

day when i'm going to open the presents

and all of that

and my father is saying happy birthday

and i'm thinking that

well it's a special gift i think it

might be it could be a bike i'm hoping

it's going to be a bike

or i'm i was hoping that it could be

maybe something like skates

ice skating because i was into ice

skating and i also wanted

maybe some new skis something like that

bicycle skate skis that would have been

great

and i was just sitting there wondering

what it's going to be

and then the time came when we're

opening the gifts and

the whole family is around my older

brother and sister and the younger ones

are there

and when they were there and when i

opened

the gift i don't even know if you'll

know what this is when i tell you

when i opened the gift what was inside

was a wooden press

to keep a tennis racket from warping

now i played tennis i knew what this

was i had a tennis racket

in fact a new tennis racket might have

been nice but why did i need a new press

because there were wooden tennis

racquets

back then and i was just devastated

and disappointed and my father seemed

very pleased and my mother seemed very

pleased

but my brother seemed smug peter right

peter yeah and faith seemed not terribly

interested

so i didn't get what i wanted why do you

think they gave you that

because they i don't know is it what it

represented to you that you weren't

what my yeah i think what that story is

really about

karen is um as the third child

in a family of six children

i really felt

less than most of the other children

except maybe my youngest sister but

anyway

the last the sixth one and at that time

at 10 years old

i think what i really wanted to feel

i wanted to feel is that i was as

special if

not more special than my older brother

and sister and this 10th birthday gift

would do it

and only once would you get to do this

and i know what they got

and i know and then i saw what i got and

it just didn't do it

so my expectation is that after that i

get the gift

my self-esteem would be super high i

would feel proud of myself i would feel

important but i didn't

okay now getting back to sequencing

a story right

the question is with that story where do

you start

now the story and you know this from

filmmaking to

the story could start at the moment of

opening the gift

say what would happen i could this is

what i'll we'll do with students a lot

of time what would happen if you start

with the opening of the gift

well then i said yeah but no but you

don't reveal what the gift is you

you start at the moment of the opening

again the moment when the

adrenaline is so high and the

anticipation is so

huge and you start then and then you go

back to

the beg to the beginning and start that

way what happens if you

tell the story out of order the

important thing is that by the time the

story is told

completely the audience has all the

information that you're going to give

them that's it

but it doesn't mean they need it in

chronological

order in fact it could start

after the opening after

as i'm walking back to my room and i

could start

with the story talking about me walking

back to my room with

my gifts devastated destroyed

feeling despondent i feel like i want to

cry

it could start there and now if you

think about it if you start there the

audience is going what happened

what happened to you that was so awful

and you're carrying birthday gifts and

you want to cry

the audience has no frame of reference

to make sense out of that

which is great because it makes the

audience curious

then i can go back to the excitement

about what i'm going to get now the

audience knows the end

and they're trying to figure they're not

trying to figure out where it's going to

go

but they're telling me how did it get

from this to that

i could even throw in the middle of it

how much i love tennis

throughout the middle of the story so

that

the tennis the the press for the tennis

racket

the audience will think well that's

great but they realize it's not great

because it's not

greater than what peter and faith got

and where do i get that information in

so it's it's

it's not so that's a that's the

sequencing where are you going to start

where do you want to finish that's the

sequencing of a story

now this is actually a lot of the

um storytelling techniques that we teach

in write your life with autobiographical

stories

come from film

film editing now you've seen films that

start in the middle

you've seen events that start there

you've seen flashbacks you go what is

that

and all of that process

mark can you share with us your use of

two narrators

yes um these the story i just

told you about my uh 10th birthday

was told mostly in the past tense

now what we will do when someone says

asks you something and you're about to

tell

an autobiographical story or you want to

tell a story or you want to tell

someone about what you just witnessed or

you saw a week or two ago

you will by instinct there's a lot of

reasons for this tell it in the past

tense

you will say okay it was last wednesday

and i was driving my car

on the freeway and then i saw and it's

in the past tense now as soon as you are

telling the story in the past tense

the listener automatically knows

several things they know

that you know the ending of the story

now that sounds silly or maybe a little

confusing

why wouldn't you of course you do know

the ending but when you tell it in the

past tense

that narrator talking to past tense

knows the end of the story that narrator

also knows

everything that's happened since that

story until the present moment

that's why we call it the omniscient

narrator the narrator who knows

everything i know the story i'm going to

tell you i know how it

ends i know everything that's happened

since then i know the repercussions of

that story i know

everything so it actually means that in

the telling of the story the story is

like

here and the storyteller is here telling

about this thing and you the listener

are there and there's the story so the

story is separate

from me the storyteller and separate

from you

it's this entity that exists by itself

here

then there's another narrator the other

narrator is

is called the naive narrator

and this is the tricky one and very very

powerful

the naive narrator tells the story

in the present tense

tells the story not only just in the

present tense but is telling the story

from the point that the

character is in at the moment

not knowing even what's going to happen

in the next few

seconds so rather than in the past tense

okay it was last wednesday i was driving

my car on the 405.

that's the omniscient narrator the naive

narrator i'm driving my car

i'm on the 405. now it's in the present

tense now right then just the fact that

you hear it in the present tense

shifts the whole story because it sounds

like

i don't know what's going to happen i'm

driving on the 405

and i see this little yellow car and

it's zooming it's zooming up behind me i

can see it in my rear view mirror

now i can tell you all that you still

get the feeling that i don't

know what's going to happen although

of course if you're smart enough you'll

say well mark is telling me this story

he's here in front of me he must know

how it's going to end but my feeling is

he doesn't he doesn't because he's put

himself

in the middle of the story telling the

story as

it happens he is totally totally naive

now karen the story is not here with me

here

the story is around me and it's actually

around

you too you are in the middle of the

story

i'm in the middle of the story and quite

honestly that's where

you want to be now think about this

every screenplay that you've ever read

i'm assuming you've read a lot of them

they're all in the present tense they're

all

in the present tense jim does this he

does that he does this he does that

do you know why they're in the present

tense because when it's up on the screen

we want to believe it's happening as we

watch it now we as an audience of

film are smart enough to know

that we go to see a movie

we know they spent how many years

writing it how many

months shooting it how you know all the

work they've done it's done

it's finished but we go and we watch it

suspending disbelief and i'll believing

that that what we are watching right now

on the screen

is happening in the moment because

that's where we want to be

so the naive narrator

can take us into the center of the story

so as you're telling a story it's not

which narrator you use

it's when you use each narrator

that gives you control over the story

in other words i could be telling you

the story i'm making up this story about

the 405. it's just as good as anything

else

i'm driving on the 405. i'm a 405 and

i'm feeling nervous because behind me i

see in this rearview mirror this yellow

car is coming at me and he he or she or

whatever is going way too fast and i'm

really scared

now that's all the naive narrator

and you are probably in the point of

going what's going to happen what's

going to happen now i

as the storyteller and this is the

beauty of being a storyteller

i am in total control of this story

and i at any time i want can pop you out

of the story right now you're in the

middle of the story

i can pop you out at any time i want

and i can say the car is coming at me

it's coming faster and faster now you

got to understand something about me and

yellow cars

you know the first car i ever bought was

a yellow station wagon

it was really an ugly car now what i

just did is i

jumped to the other narrator

i jumped out of the story i jumped to

the other narrator i'm giving you some

information that i think you need to

have which will help inform the story

but i've left you hanging about what's

going on

in the story and there's a part of you

go okay great information but what's

happening there

okay i got it i got it now i have you

curious about two things why am i

getting this new information

and what's happening there and then any

moment i can see and

then i look in the rear view mirror and

it's coming closer and closer and closer

and i can see there's nobody driving it

there's nobody so i can switch back and

forth now

as i switch back and forth between those

two narrators i'm actually

manipulating you i'm bringing you

into the story pulling you out of the

story bring you into the story

pull you out of the story that's all

part of the structure of the story that

i want to tell that's how i want to tell

it

when playing with you and playing with

your relationship

to the story do we like being

manipulated

does the audience i mean i realize

that's a weird way to say it but does

that something we like

do you like roller coasters i don't you

don't but i like movies

but you like movies but i don't like

roller coasters okay but you did that so

that's why

um but i i think

there's sort of a wonderful love-hate

relationship with being manipulated

i don't want to be manipulated and then

we go through a movie oh

that's so scary wasn't that great and

i'm thinking well you were just

manipulated

i think we find our forms of

entertainment that manipulate us whether

it's roller coaster rides

or a movie that take us into

danger take us into a zone of danger

where we feel that we're at risk roller

coaster ride we could die

you feel that way sometimes in a movie

it's an emotional danger and i'm going

to feel sad i'm going to feel hurt i'm

going to feel scared

but then you can we come out going wow

that was great

i want to see that again but i said you

were scared you were screaming

out of fear so there's this curious

relationship we have

my feeling is when we go to see a movie

or we read a book or we

or hear a story being told is

please please manipulate me

thrill me scare me dazzle me my only

caveat is don't bore me

don't be boring i don't mind movies that

i hate

because i felt hate i hate this then i

hate these

i don't mind characters that i hate

people say wasn't that one i

hated her whatever it is it doesn't

matter

and all these characters and all these

stories they do manipulate us

but the worst thing is to go there's no

point to watching this there's nothing

going on this is just boring that's the

worst

how do most people use the naive

narrator

incorrectly and then the omniscient

narrator incorrectly several things

about the two narratives you need to

understand

and how they can be if they're used

incorrectly they just won't be effective

at all one thing about

the omniscient narrator the omniscient

narrator does

know everything the omniscient narrator

since the omniscient narrator is talking

about an event there and is

actually that narrator is not involved

in the event

that narrator is only telling about the

event

the mistake you can do is say okay i'm

going to tell this story and then i'm

going to get really emotional

so that the audience will know how

emotionally i was affected at that

time but you're still telling it in the

past tense

and when she looked at me i was when i

wanted to cry and then she did this and

then she did that

and you know what we have now therapy

why am i telling the story am i telling

the story because i want to go through

those emotions again

because we can feel the audience can

feel that emotion is not connected with

the story that

that emotion is connected with the

memory of the story

so the emotional journey of the

character does not belong

in that narrator it belongs

in the naive narrator now the naive

narrator just say

you know and she's looking at me and i'm

really scared now i'm in the present

tense and i go

that's totally acceptable because you're

telling me what's going on and how

you're feeling which is also what's

going on

in the moment but

if the naive narrator tries to put this

into some larger perspective

i'm looking at her you got to understand

you know i

i've really had a lot of trouble with

relationships for a long time

you go where are you going why are you

thinking about that in the middle of

this

this moment with this woman why

that's the job of the omniscient

narrator

they each have separate jobs and they

have to you have to be

purely in one or the other

all the time you also have an

interrogation process

for writers with the travis technique

right and it's entitled meet your

characters

that's part of it uh because you start

out saying interrogation process for

writers which

there are a lot of techniques within

that

and the interrogation process

just to be clear about what it is is

actually interrogating um

a character who lives inside an actor

or an individual so this interrogation

process which can

ignite characters inside the actors

we use this with writers and we show

writers how to do this

to actually meet their characters

either while after they've written the

screenplay while they're writing the

screenplay

often we've done it they even have an

idea for a screenplay

and they say we get a call say i'd like

to do meet your characters can you help

me

meet the characters that i have and so

the writer will then describe to us to

elsa and i

here here's the story here are the

characters we say fine

we'll gather together some actors who

are very skilled actors who we've worked

with before

and what we will do with these actors is

we will give

them um along with the

writer's understanding of what we're

doing a certain amount of information

about these characters sometimes it's

very little information

sometimes it's a lot of information all

depends on how developed the writer has

gone how far they've gone in the

development of the characters

and we will interrogate these actors

as these characters so we will turn

these actors into these characters

that's the interior and then we will put

actually put these characters together

we'll have them

interact we will have the show the

writer how

not only how to do the interrogation but

allow the writer

to actually engage with the characters

so let's say there's three or four

characters that we've interrogated and

they're all the characters now

all these actors have become the

characters and now the writer can engage

with the characters

and ask them questions

and interrogate them and start to learn

to he will actually

meet his characters sometimes the writer

says

will say to us i have this idea for a

scene i want between the husband and

wife

i say great great we'll do that during

the interrogation

we'll interrogate the husband and wife

and we'll put them into that scene

now there is no scene there's nothing

written

but it's a scene maybe when he comes

home and he discovers that she bought

the red dress that he told her she

couldn't buy or something like that

and he discovered that she bought it and

that's they have little very little

information

but enough information for a scene this

is important for a scene to get

started that's all there's no more

information beyond that there's no

information about what the father

the husband or the wife say or do and

there's no information about how the

scene

ends it's just enough to get them into

the scene because the important thing

about interrogation

is once we interrogate an actor as the

character that character

knows nothing about the script or the

story

nothing now the actor may know a lot but

the character knows nothing the

character

is totally naive so we can send those

characters into

a scene just enough to get the scene

started and see what happens and now the

writer is sitting there

watching an interaction between two of

his characters

happen something he hasn't even written

yet can we try that now with something

we can we can and keep in mind i'm not a

professional writer here so this is

going to be a very very

light story um so my character that i've

come with

up with is her name is jill she's 26

years old

she's unmarried and she has a seven

month old baby with a man named jack

so because of some life issues jill and

jack have lost their right to stay at

jill's grandmother's home

where they were all living and then

after being kicked out of there they

move into jack's brother's home

and jack's brother is kind of several

steps up he has a stable job and a

family life

but before you know it jill and jack are

then again asked to leave

and they have with their baby baby maya

and so now they've been

asked to leave two places um

so before jill fell into this situation

she um planned on going to chef school

and she was always artistic the

situation you mean pregnancy

uh and meeting jack i think jack

came before the pregnancy

that's true it wasn't an immaculate

conception yeah no no but

you said this situation before she got

into this relationship this relationship

right yeah and and then

this baby and then being bounced around

from these different

she wanted to go she wanted to be a chef

yeah she wanted to be a chef and she was

very artistic

and um unfortunately some of her demons

got the better of her

and she met jack while attending night

school

for this this chef sort of career and

they both fell into the world of

partying and it got the better of them

so now here they are they've been kicked

out of their second place with a seventh

month old baby

and uh i want to get to know jill better

okay and this uh karen is your creation

is

this this character is your creation

yeah just for the sake of this interview

yeah i'm not it's not like i'm writing

something no but it's your creation it

didn't come from something else

no no just jack and jill or you know

those are

those are used elsewhere but yeah so now

you want to meet that character

yeah the character okay that's fine so i

need to talk to jill

okay okay do you want me to be am i jill

or

this is where jill lives inside you

okay so i need to talk to jill okay okay

child but he won't i mean

he's not what is it what is he doing

he's not reliable what is he doing is he

not right now he was or he's not working

he was and are you working now

not right now and in order to pursue

being a chef what do you have to do

well i need to go back and finish these

other credits

there's a couple classes i didn't finish

oh you've got a couple classes you have

to finish and then you get a certificate

or a degree or something

right and then i want to be accepted

into this other like more professional

chef school

okay and then to move on to a more

professional school so you got a plan

this is this i mean this is a plan i

maya wasn't planned

i didn't say that it doesn't mean i

don't love it in terms of chefing

being a chef you have a plan right the

gut that sort of got interrupted a

little bit

a little bit but you know that happens

yeah so it happens to a lot of people

so when are you going to start you know

working on these credits

well i need like my grandmother was

paying for it

and then does jack love you

in his own way what does that mean

he has a weird his his own way of loving

what what is it

he has like trust issues trust trustee

we both do

it's not just him i have trust issues

can you trust him

not with money no not with money

i mean he you want to marry him

if he if he stops drinking i do if he

stops oh he's got a drinking problem

yeah

he's got a drinking problem he doesn't

have a job you can't trust him

why would he he's a good guy he's a good

guy for what

does he watch after mia does he want you

to go back to chef school

i think he gets jealous he wants you to

go back to chef school he's jealous i'm

going to meet someone there

oh no he's jealous you're going to meet

someone so he wants to keep you at home

because he saw my instructor and i were

working

and he just said like i don't like the

way you stare at him and he stares at

you

is that why he was so excited when you

got pregnant

don't know how excited he was

is that his way of keeping you at home

jill

why does he want to keep you at home

he's not doing anything

when you're at home with me where's jack

he's watching tv he's watching tv he

needs his time

to watch sports and drink and and just

be like is that what he says or is that

what you say

well i want to respect him and his

wishes do you respect him

and his wishes to stay home and watch tv

and drink

beer with his friends is that what he

does

no i mean i i mean yeah that's what he

does but i don't

why were you kicked out of the house

um we got some fights

with who uh well he got mad at my

grandmother and my grandmother said that

he took some money

from from her i don't think he did i

think it was somebody else

but she blames do you think he could

have

maybe do you think he was capable of

that

yeah but i i don't she doesn't like him

and so anything he does

like she just automatically wants to

blame them

yeah and who during that argument

between your grandmother and jack right

what did you say why did you defend

jill i guess you defend jack

i asked him to keep his voice that he

yells at her and i don't like

that keeping his voice down that's not

the issue the issue is she accused him

of stealing some money and she's going

to kick him out of the house

who were you defending

i was defending him why he's just had it

rough

and so he oh so you have to take care of

him

you have to protect him now you have two

children jill

you have two children one's only a few

months old

the other one's in his 20s or something

is this the way the rest of your life is

going to go

do you love your grandmother i know do

you love your grandmother

yes i do she's believed in me when

she's always good to you yes she took

you in when you needed help

when you got pregnant and you didn't

know where to go she

protected you and then you protected him

against her

if you left jack with mia

could you go back to live with your

grandmother

she says she won't give me any more

money i didn't ask you that

could you live with her

maybe would she watch mia she loves me

yeah she's been she's been willing to

watch her but she doesn't

like his drinking so she's no no i

didn't say him

he's not going back you're going back

with mia

would she let you live with her you and

mia

but then he'll just be gone i know he'll

be gone

would it's not an answer would she let

you live with her

would she watch mia for you would she

let you go back to school

would she support you the way jack

doesn't

[Music]

what do you want jill i just want us all

to be happy the three of us

well that's great everybody wants that

what are you going to do but i think

that with the right

time he can be better right time for

what

just if he just needs someone to believe

in him no one believed in him and so he

needs people to believe in him no one

believes in him so

i believe in him it's your job to

believe in him

and do you believe in him if he could

just

no do you believe in him

it's easy to say you believe in someone

if they stop all the horrible things

they're doing anybody can say that

do you believe in him now have he not

stopped anything he's still drinking he

still doesn't trust you

he's horrible with money he's not going

to support you he's not going to watch

the child for you to go back to school

he's not doing any of that

do you believe in him he's do you want

to be a place

what's that he's in a negative place

right now he certainly is do you believe

in him do you want to be with him jill

i believe in you do you want to be with

me i do want to be with him

why because we you know

things were better before like you know

his current behavior and he just had

more he was just fun and and

[Music]

i think that he just needs some time to

to become a better

person you know he didn't have a lot of

role models growing up and i know that's

i can't like use that as an excuse but

i just think that if someone believes in

him he will turn it around

if someone and that someone happens to

be you

but you don't believe in him

some days it's clear that you don't

believe in some days i do or some days

oh that's great

how about 100 believe in him 100 percent

love him 100 support him he changes when

he drinks

so he says he just wants to have a beer

every now and then and watch

if you could wave a magic wand

what would you ask for that

we would get married and that he would

stop drinking and that we would both get

jobs

and we wouldn't have to rely on my

grandmother

that you would get married yeah does he

want to get married

he says one day what's up one day i mean

his parents weren't married

so what so and it doesn't mean anything

so he doesn't believe in the institution

of marriage

i see so he really doesn't want to get

married

but you want to get married yeah does he

want to get a job

that was part of the magic wand thing is

that he got a job does he want to get a

job

have you ever heard him talk about a job

that he really wants

and that he's willing to go for it

what does he want to do besides sit home

and drink and watch tv

like i said he's just in a bad place

right now and then if you could just get

him in a better place then

jill you're living with a parasite you

know that

he's going to suck everything out of you

everything

all your energy all your joy all your

talent

all your hopes all your dreams

until you're sucked dry and then he'll

probably leave you

but i don't want mia to grow up without

a father

i want her to have him there i mean i i

know he's not perfect

i'm not perfect i'm not perfect so

i can't expect him to be perfect you can

expect him to be better than he is

you can expect him to respect you

you can expect him to love you you can

expect him to support you

you can expect him to sacrifice things

that are important to him

to help you if it's a marriage

just being married won't make it any

better you know that

it'll be just the same as it is now

well he says he loves mia

and i'm sure he does i'm sure he does

do you love mia absolutely do you want

her to grow up with a father like that

just because he's the biological father

he's the only choice

i just don't want to do that to her

do what do what i don't want her to not

know who raised her

i mean like who who her dad was i don't

want her she doesn't know it

she can know him like question mark she

can know him

how are you going to protect me

i know one day she'll be strong and

she'll see that he does love her

he's just going through some he just

he's not perfect he has

issues but i'm not perfect either so i

can't

totally just expect him to be perfect

you know

he says that i nag him all the time and

that i'm always on this case

okay so so you're so you're going to

um hang in there

yeah i thought about maybe moving back

to my grandmother's with me

and then but i don't know where he's

going to go so

but do it you can do that move back with

your grandmother

you're a beautiful strong vibrant young

woman who wants to be a chef

you have everything in front of you you

can make any choice you want to make

just make it there's nothing stopping

you

but what's going to happen to him he

doesn't have anywhere to go who knows

that's his problem

i just don't want him to become more

self-destructive than he already is

it may happen but it won't be your fault

he's a great father isn't he

like i said when he's in a good place

he's a good place he's a great father

he seems like it i mean and you're happy

when he's a great father

right when he's a good place yeah

so stay with him just stay with him

maybe it'll work out who knows

he just he doesn't like it when i like

not that i'm not telling him where i'm

going and he wants to like know like

where i am all the time and so

it's just hard for me to like have a

life and then he's there and i

you know if you could tell

jack anything you wanted without fear

of what would happen anything

what would you tell him i just want to

see him

be better and believe in himself and

just

he doesn't need to always have like a

beer

it seems like every hour with that's

what you want to tell him

i just i want to see him like be the

person i know he can be

what do you really think of him i think

that he

just never had anyone believe in him but

i see a difference what do you think of

him what do you jill

think of jack

i don't know he's become so negative i'm

gonna ask you one last question

if you had to do headed to do all over

again

would you have gotten involved with jack

no

no i would have stayed at the school and

just

okay kept going okay

now we're gonna stop okay

so what was that like painful

painful yeah i feel bad for jill okay

she's stuck you know and um

you know she doesn't have any resources

and she's relying on his grandmother

and um

[Music]

you know maybe jack's a good guy but

she's not that's not her

fault it's not she can't fix him but um

she's like stuck in this pit and you're

right she's taking care of two children

and um i guess i want her to have a

backbone

you want her to have a backbone yeah but

the since

since we did this because of meet your

characters right

and this is not about you karen playing

jill this is about you meeting the jill

that's

existing inside you sure

um were there any surprises

how much maybe she made excuses for all

these things or

like you brought them out to light and

she just kept like making excuses for

them

like if only if only if only sure in a

perfect world but

a perfect world and if it just needs

time i mean all the all the excuses that

she makes

for him which i don't think she would

make

if it wasn't for mia um that's

interesting

yeah that's true because the child

changed everything not getting together

with jack it was the child

right changed everything and it changed

her perspective

that's true and protecting him

protecting him because you're really

protecting her and the whole thing

you want her to have a father i said

well you know she can have a father

there's more than one out there

that's true that could be the father but

that's you know

because lots of times when we do this um

this process

with the writer treating you as the

writer of this story

is that the writer will discover things

about

their protagonist or any character in

their story that they

never imagined just because it's done

through the interrogation

process where the character is actually

speaking now

it's coming from within the writer but

it's because of the way the process

works

of the very intense probing questions

that's why it's called interrogation

probing questions about who you are

and there's something unique that i've

been experiencing for years now for both

writers and actors when they go through

this process

because they're under the pressure of

the character having to answer

immediately not under the pressure of oh

let me think about that i'll

journal about that let me think about

let me think about what jill would do in

that circumstance

that that can't play at all what plays

is jill is being asked

and you're playing and you are being

jill and jill has to answer

and so jill i'm sure you experienced

that like i have

yeah i karen can't stay oh excuse me i

don't know the answer to that can we go

on to

no there's no there's no room for that

jill

has to answer and so many times you're

surprised by what

the what comes out of the character or

the character's perspective or point of

view or something

and we've done this many times where

writers have said

my god i didn't know he or she thought

that

it's amazing no it's not because of

something i do in other words i'm not

injecting

information into the character at all

i'm just questioning

the character and the character has to

answer and you're in

and you're free to say anything you want

and the answer you want

so that a lot of times they're surprised

but the character does exist inside you

because you created that character and

you know that character better than

anybody

and all we're doing is moving

you the writer out of the way

so you i'm i'm not allowing you karen

the writer to control the character

you just have to sit on the side and

watch the character emerge

and be questioned and be interrogated

and be herself

then you go wow that's a different

person than i thought

i was scared you're interrogating

because i i saw that my life was like

backed into this corner and that there

were no solutions

to it and

[Music]

you know it's loose i had thought of a

story like this

years ago i never really did much with

it but it was kind of based on

people that i would see um that were

like young families that kind of like

lived in

trailers and different things and i

always wondered like how did they get

there i'm sure that's not something they

planned and

um you know how do we know

that couldn't have been any of us right

there with the with the

certain set of circumstances and so you

know you'll just see someone on the

street and you just like

start wondering about their life and um

just just yeah i felt like

i think i felt more like jill than i

ever had i actually had a different

name for the character before but um we

changed it because it was so it was a

different name it was like very unusual

but i did i felt very scared and like i

had no choices and no

no say no agency in my own life and so

you were

showing me as jill that like you know

there's not many places to go with this

you know

so yeah and a lot of what we do with

jill too

is and this happens a lot of

interrogation is push the character

up against their obstacles and it's um

the obstacles that are inside them the

fears i mean

jill's fear of not having

jack around which is really irrational

but

understandable understandable because

that's what happens

but like how because even when i said

move back with the grandmother and all

that you and mia but

you say yeah but what's going to happen

to jack i go

excuse me i'm giving you an opportunity

to get out of a bad situation and all

you want to do is get back in it

but just to run into that so we you know

it's it's a matter of pushing the

character

up against even their fears or their

denial or their rationalization or

justification

and question it not saying it's wrong

but just can you

explain to me why you think that way

that's all i was doing

explain that to me and i could see you

you're going oh yeah

i can't i can't well then we have a

problem

that's it great that's what

and that's what we do with and now

there's one other thing

that process is similar to what we do

with writers with the write your life

too

except we're interrogating them as

themselves at a different time

but it's the same process and the same

many times the same thing will happen

even you go oh wow i didn't know that

that's what i was thinking back then

and what happens when it's with write

your life or autobiographical

is and i'm very much aware of this and i

have to be a little more delicate

sometimes

because i'm actually interrogating you

as you so i have to be much more careful

i can't

be as aggressive sometimes

because but many times what i'm

triggering

is the truth that has been buried

and the people are surprised that this

came out and they they can feel that

it's true they can feel that this is

what was really going on they could feel

that this was really the fears that they

were dealing with

and now they go back to look at the

story and they see it in a whole

different way because they see

their protagonist in a different way

yeah and i see this character in a

different way now

good we just finished the meet your

character

interrogation process mark where

hypothetical character i came up with

i'm wondering when you do this with

other writers

what's the most common reaction

afterwards that they have

after meeting their character okay um

if it's meeting the characters like we

did with you where the character comes

from within you

as opposed to meeting the characters

when they come out of actors

right i'm going back to what we did with

you

the reaction is

usually surprised by what they learned

that they didn't

know they're surprised by what the

character

says or what the character does or what

the character believes in or doesn't

believe in

and a lot of that of course i have no

idea what's going to come up because i

don't know

the characters that well as well as the

writer does

and i don't know how they perceive the

character and many times the writer will

perceive the character in a very

precious way

this is who she is and this is what i

want her to be

which is a very controlling way so then

what will happen during the

interrogation

is something to come out that is outside

of that or or different from that

perception that they have or that

creation that they have in their mind

that the character will start talking in

a way or behaving in a way or responding

in a way that they

that they never would have allowed the

character to do as the writer

but there's the character doing it

there's the character saying that

there's a character

expressing those feelings those ideas

and they're surprised so normally then

it would be

a group of actors or an actor as this

character jill or jack

these two characters or maybe even the

grandmother who knows

yeah and the writer would be watching

you interrogate those people

as those characters well yes i mean when

when we get into the write your life

with a writer and we have a group of

actors

who are going to become their characters

um it's it's a

a little more complicated process

because simult depending on who the

writer is simultaneously i have to

besides interrogating all the actors to

become those characters i have

i'm simultaneously training the writer

how to do this

how to to the very sort of the very

beginning steps of interrogation process

and how it can work

and then even then once i've

interrogated the actors to be those

characters i will bring the writer in to

start talking to the characters it won't

be just

me and to even get involved in the

interrogation

so that's the part of the meeting i can

be interrogating i can be interrogated

and an actor says jill the character we

just

did and i could have the writer right

next to me i could have you right next

to me if we're doing this and you're the

writer

and i could just tap you like go talk to

her

and keep keep up the interrogation just

keep it going and explore

and you may have other questions you

want to ask and and other other things

points of view you want to express to

her to see what's happening so there's

it's a process of not only just working

with the actors but bringing the writer

into the process and then eventually

engaging them with

all the characters and something that

elsia mentioned

um that just for the sake of the camera

i guess we couldn't do is that

i'm sitting in karen's seat

referring to myself in the third person

yeah so the lines between jill and karen

are going to be sort of they'd be if i

was standing up

and outside of this seat then it would

be more that i'm jill i guess

yeah you feel you feel more of a

separation right

exactly interesting great

do you find that writers become quite

emotional

because they've met their characters um

sometimes yeah sometimes they um

sometimes emotional because they are

responding to the characters

i guess in a way that they hope that the

audience will that they're actually

meeting them and realizing how

vulnerable they are or how scared they

are or how magnificent they are and

going wow this

is really um moved

by the characters and sometimes they'll

become very emotional when

something will happen between two of the

characters

[Music]

that they hadn't imagined but actually

is

um working into the story that they want

to tell

let's say it's just between two

characters who have never met before

and suddenly there's a connection and

one character says he feels that way

about the other characters they'll

talk about how they feel in the

interrogation how they feel about each

other and how they see each other

and sometimes the writer will oh my god

i never imagined that that could happen

there could be that connection between

the two and they'll become emotional

because of that because it's a richness

of the characters and the character

relationship that they hadn't really

conceived of yet and then do you find

conversely that they don't like their

character they don't have any empathy

toward them

and they go you know what i need to go

back to the drawing board this isn't the

character

that i thought they were yeah and

yeah sometimes they're going oh okay

that character didn't turn out the way i

had hoped then it would be going back to

okay what were you looking for

because we're basing it on what you told

me or you told us

and maybe you need to alter something

along those lines and we could do it

again

quite honestly we could do it again

almost immediately if they say i want to

i want to approach this character in a

different way

say okay let's do it talk about it and

the actor can be sitting there listening

to it

and say okay we're going to approach the

character or i'll go to another actor so

i'm going to do another actor for that

character

and start interrogating them and

interrogate them into the character

again

and we'll have a different version of

the character

man i would love to that i mean that

just sounds

so exciting even though i'm not really

invested in this character that i have

this hypothetical

story but um just it sounds like really

really fascinating to see

this thing that was in your imagination

just like

very powerful good you talk about

something called the bully and the

butterfly

your committee as it relates to meeting

characters

yes another big topic and i

think karen i think we talked about this

in the last interview

many many years ago okay my memories no

no no no that's

no that's okay this this has to do with

the committee

now the committee i'll explain

in fact in the interrogation that we

just did

there was the committee but i'll explain

how that works

the um the term committee

the way we use it stan

represents all the voices in your head

so all the voices in your head karen or

david head

david's head houses there's many voices

in there

and as you know these voices in our

heads that we all have

we talk to them they talk to us they

criticize us they praise us

they advise us or whatever they get in

the way sometimes

and there are a lot of them that's why i

call it the committee

because i feel like there's a lot in my

head i feel like there's a lot of these

voices and they are

sometimes in session discussing

something

so the voices in the head of us as

humans are very important because i feel

like

my committee your committee david's or

else's committee

or i'll go back to your committee for

karen your committee

knows everything about you everything

even stuff that nobody else knows it's

in there

somewhere so when you think about the

fact that we have all these voices in

our head and these voices know

everything about us and

each voice in our head has different

opinions about that subject or that

topic or any subject or any topic

this is a very rich territory inside any

human being

but then think about a character a

character in a movie

a character like jill jill has a

committee

and if you could get into her committee

if you could

visit her committee you would know more

about

jill but the problem is in screenplays

and most stories that were plays however

they were written

we are given no information at all about

the committee inside a character

nothing we know what the character does

we know what the character says we know

what the character

expels she expresses herself what she

wants what her needs are

we get a little idea of what she's

afraid of and all that but we really

don't know what's going on

inside her head okay

because inside her head inside jill's

head

are all of these voices

right now what is it the butt butterfly

and the

and the bully the bully the bully and

the butterfly

yeah colin you're committing yeah the

bully now what i just did

with you with jill and that was mostly

the bully the bully that there's a voice

inside jill's head which is saying

get out get out get out get out get out

what you ex kept trying to hold on to

was another voice this will work this

will work

if i give him time you're trying that's

the butterfly

if you're trying to hold on sometimes

there were a couple of times when i was

talking to you i would support the

butterfly

but then i would go back to the bully so

the thing is there's a war

going on inside the committee

there's a war going on inside every one

of our committees it's ju

it's it's chaos in there so the

interrogation

is giving voice to all of those voices

so every time i i can attack you about

something

i can praise you about something those

are two different voices of the

committee

inside jill's head and jill

by jill you as voicing jill

responding to those voices of her

committee

every time you respond jill gets formed

a little bit more

a little bit more a little bit more so

jill is getting

formed by forming the committee

not by telling the actress or the writer

who

jill is but by forming jill

through the interrogation process

and then are they also forming who jack

is

same thing because they're confronting

her on these different things

well i mean by confronting well we're

forming

yes we're forming jill's point of view

of jack now if i interrogate jack

or if i interrogate you as jack or

interrogate somebody else as jack

it won't be the same as jill jack has

his point of view

jack has his jack has his committee

his committees that says you know she

should take care of me this is what the

you know she's the wife i'm just making

it up i don't know

but he will have his committee that

justifies his behavior

or questions his behavior he's got

a different committee but it's also in

chaos so these committees are in chaos

and it's building a character from deep

deep inside the character

where quite respectfully to writers and

actors

writers and actors will create the

character from

outside writers will design a character

you design this character

actors will look at a script and go okay

oh no i

i can design a character that will do

those things that are in the script

but that's not really developing the

character at all that's really

creating sort of like a puppet that will

do the things that are demanded in the

script

the thing is what's going on inside that

character

that causes him or her to do those

things in the script

that's what you have to build and that

has to be built

from way deep inside not on the outside

so when someone's writing a script and

we're not connecting to the character

is that because it's almost a puppet it

could be

it could be a two-dimensional character

yep a puppet who's just

doing i mean we've all seen films or

plays or whatever

where our television where we go

the only reason that characters doing

that is because the writer needs them to

do that

right so it's not the character it's the

writer

pulling strings to get the character to

do that so that the story will work out

that happens too often

and why do you think this this meeting

their characters and the interrogation

why do you think it just

puts you in a different mindset because

i'm already in a different mindset about

a character that

i just kind of like came up with and

i've been thinking about for years but

never really did anything with

so i'm not totally invested but now like

i feel like that person is real

from just sitting here with you for that

10 to 15 minute span

why do you think it works what is it

that happens

i think part of the reason it's a great

question i think

part of the reason it works

for both writers and actors but we'll

talk about writers for a second

is because that's sort of the situation

you're in with jill

is suddenly there's a respect for

another human being

you feel like there's another human

being existing who's jill

and i've met her or there's these other

human beings of these characters that i

thought i created

i've met them in person and i

now i have an obligation to them

as the writer to honor them

not i have a task of creating them

i have a task of honoring them and who

they are and what that relationship is

so i think there's a there's a um a

different respect

and i think the same thing happens for

actors when they've been interrogated

they

feel they've had this experience of this

character that lives inside them and

still it's like i need to honor this

this person

there is there is another person it's

not just

me acting so acting sort of goes away

yeah i don't know if you saw joker but

yeah if you saw

the way joaquin phoenix approached the

character of arthur fleck i mean

whether you want to say it was a

terrible human being

but you there were just so many moments

where you had at least for me as a

viewer

i had so much empathy yeah for that

character and i think that's through

joaquin's

you know treating him it's just he was a

real yeah it's his total immersion

yeah i mean it's an extraordinary

performance absolutely

and his total immersion into

that tortured human being

and it's interesting because he ends up

becoming he ends up doing

horrible things evil things killing

people

and yet i have empathy for him because

he's so tortured he's so

you know it's i mean that's an

extraordinary achievement

absolutely and the same with renee

zellweger as uh judy yeah

garland yep same thing you know

especially from just the opening scene

just

showing up the hotel with the kids and

then

not knowing if she could stay or not and

just yeah this like fragility

but then this like you know on stage

persona

it was just seeing characters like that

like you just

all time goes away yeah you know and in

that moment when you were asking

about my character time went away and i

felt like i was hurt

good we talked about compression and

expansion of time when it comes to a

writer meeting their character

okay um that that's that's really not

with the writers meeting the characters

oh okay but that's okay but

compression and expansion it has a lot

to do with

the write your life autobiographical

storytelling

the thing is that we

have a tendency by instinct or whatever

to

not only tell things in a chronological

order but to tell them

pretty much in real time and we will

tell this happened then this happened

then this happened

in other words time will feel as we're

telling the story that time is moving at

its normal pace

compression and expansion are two

techniques of playing with time

and storytelling one is compressing time

and the other is expanding it

compressing time is i could move you

through i could be telling you a story

and i can move you through

a part of the story much faster

much faster than

real time very very very very fast

and what a couple things that happens

and i'll try to give you an example

i'm going back to my driving on the 405

which is a story i just

made up um see if i can do it with that

and let's say that that's the story of

me having a tough day and i'm

racing i'm on the 405 racing to get to

an appointment or something like that

that's when i see the yellow car

but i want to tell you what the rest

let's say i want to tell you what

the rest rest of the day has been like

up till that point

but it's been a long day and there's

been a lot of things that have happened

so many that if i start listing them all

you go fine fine

fine fine and emotionally it won't do

much of it you're just gonna you'll just

get a lot of information

like if i told you that my alarm clock

didn't go off when i wanted to so i got

up late

and then i had problems with the shower

because i promised myself i'd fix it and

it was it wasn't fixed and i had to hold

it with one hand

and then as i was getting dressed i

spilled something on my favorite shirt

and then i went on and on and on

and then i did this and then as i was

going to get to the appointment i'm

going outside and my neighbor

who was really annoying wanted to talk

and she won't start talking

and then like i talked to her for a

while and then i'm going on then trying

to get to the car

now the car is fine except i should have

washed it i should have realized that

i'm going to meet this person he's going

to see my car and the car is dirty

now i could tell you know say all these

things are going on but i say i don't

want to

even take as much time as i just took

to tell that and also after a while it

goes yeah got it

yes got it got it it's been a bad day

got it got it got it

if i compress it i can tell it

very much faster much faster and

still take you on an emotional journey

let me say i'm up up up in the morning

alarm clock didn't work didn't work

didn't work supposed to be 6 30. got to

get there on time take a shower

shower's broken always been broken my

fault should have fixed it got to get

there on time where's that shirt there's

the shirt beautiful shirt put on the

shirt spill the

spill the oatmeal on it oh damn oatmeal

change the shirt don't like the shirt

gotta go gotta go outside there's rhonda

she wants to talk

can't talk hot gotta go gotta go get in

the car get in bye rhonda does she's

still talking about i wanna get in the

car should've washed the car why didn't

i wash the car

this is an important thing i should have

washed the car he's gonna see the car

got to get going

now that i just covered the same amount

of time

same amount of events but faster

and it becomes more poetic and becomes

more fractured

time that's compressing time now we do

the this

is built on what we can do in film

with jump cutting and fast cutting and

we've all seen that when it goes

we start moving moving through time

faster and it puts us in a different

rhythm and it puts us in a different

energy and it creates an

urgency just by the construction of it

of those fast cuts just by the

construction of jumping jumping jumping

jumping through all with all of that

and actually in the piece that i just

did

i wove through one phrase

that i kept repeating which you may not

recall it doesn't matter

the rep the phrase was gotta get there

on time

gotta get there on time and i can weave

that through and you may or may not

notice it you may not be

that's sort of like a little mantra that

keeps repeating

which is really what the whole

compression is about

so that's compression so many times when

we're doing these large stories

and someone says well you have to

understand everything that was happening

up until then say i got it but

we'll have to compress it it takes a lot

of work to do that

it takes a lot of work to explore that

amount of time what really happened and

then to write it

and then compress it the other one

which is much more powerful is the

expansion of time

the expansion of time we use when you

hit a point in the story

you're telling a story and it's usually

the point the key

moment in the story it's the key moment

if it's a love story it's a key moment

of the first kiss or maybe if it's a

frightening traumatic story

it's when you witness something that

just

changed your life something maybe

horrible

or maybe it was a car accident or

something or

something happened in the story which

just riveted you

and it's one of those moments when you

know something happens and your whole

body seems to change

what ripples through you the

embarrassment the

fear the shame the horror the disgust

the joy whatever is going it's just

rippling through you then you say okay

how do i tell that

and you don't want to go along and say

then i you know i looked at her looked

in her eyes

and then and then i'm kissing her and it

really felt great and

because that's all and i'm moving on you

go that's it

the expansion of time is what we do is

we stop time

we literally stop the story

so if it is the kiss and if it's you're

talking about that moment of that first

kiss

and you say i'm looking at her eyes and

her eyes are looking up at me

and i can see the sparkle in her eyes

and i

i can feel that yes this is the moment i

reach in and i start to kiss her and

my lips touch her lips and lips

touching lips warm soft

smooth joy oh

tears my tears her tears

oh touching touching wanting

needing needing feeling

breathe breathe

breathe and then i can pull myself out

of it

now that's an expansion an expansion of

time stops

the story and what it does is it

we keep telling the story but we drop

down

inside the character to really explore

what's going on

in that moment of time and time is not

moving

forward at all or if it is it's just

inching forward maybe a little

bit it's almost like slow motion now in

cinema we use slow motion and things

like to get that same feeling

here we do it because we're not getting

dealing with anything visual

we're doing it just with words just with

words

and the main things that expansion needs

it needs a trigger something to

send you into that this moment the

trigger was the lips touching

something that visually or essentially

that

send you in and it needs a release

something

to bring you out something to snap you

out of it

so that you can go back into real time

so that's that's

expansion the the release i didn't put

in

yet because i wanted to explain it first

because you have to plan the release and

if so if i'm in the middle of that kiss

and i'm talking about soft touching

kitchen now my planned release

i'm not going to bring myself out of

that feeling because it's such a

delicious feeling

even if it's a horrible traumatic

feeling you may want to bring yourself

out but you can't

something else has to bring you out of

it somebody saying my name

would bring me out of it so if it's

touching the

lips touch warm smooth touching lips

more

want more and more mark yeah something

like that

pam so then it brings me out of it so

that's what expansion expansion allows

you to just

immerse yourself in the the joy or the

horror

or the trauma or the exhilarates

whatever it is

of the moment of that key moment and

usually this is

what the whole story is aiming for at

this moment anyway and you want to take

time with it

that's expansion do you think that

people should follow

their dreams and along those lines if

they

should follow their dreams when should

an artist leave their day job

boy that's that's a tricky one it's a

really tricky question because there's a

part of me i'll give you

this is my committee giving several

answers

okay there's a part of me that says

don't leave your don't leave your day

job

until it becomes absolutely impossible

to stay in it

because of the dream you're following

see how long you can stay

in the day job

and i'm just thinking about security and

all that then there's another part

that says i'll leave it just go at any

time

now i'm in some in some ways i'm not a

great person to ask this because

um when i started in this business i've

had very few quote

day jobs i've been i've just been able

to create a lot of jobs or create a lot

of work or do a lot of things that i

wanted to do and then

there were times years and years and

years ago 30 40 years ago i had day jobs

while i was still pursuing this but as

soon as i got a job

directing or job something in the

business day job was gone

immediately so i was one of those that

would just quit immediately

but then sometimes months later i would

find myself in deep trouble

because that job was over the job i did

it was fine

that done but there was no job following

it

and then i was found myself scrambling

again

to put something together at least to

support myself so i don't you know but

the following of the dreams

i think the the big question

is do you have a plan do you have a

vision of how you're going to

uh pursue uh what you want

and this is also from personal

experience

i've at times

unfortunately relied too heavily on

jobs showing up or someone helping me

out

and not taking care of it myself

then i've swung the other way and

created a whole business on my own to

support myself

which is and still in my business which

i'm doing now to support myself so i've

gone both

both ways i think it's looking at

what is what is my plan what is my plan

for today or let's put it this way

this has something to do with what else

and i are looking into now

is what your dream

where do you imagine you would be five

years from now following your dream

can you imagine where you would be and

what and just

write about what that is and describe

what that is

okay now come back where would you be

five months from now in that dream

describe that

okay then you come back where would you

be

five days from now following your dream

and can you describe that now you

described goals and pinpoints

and then the last thing is what can you

do in the next hour

to fulfill that dream doing that you'll

start to

see possibly a plan a goal

a map of some sort i think too many

people

are following dreams i want to be a

great actress i want to be a great

writer but there's no map

there's no i'm going to i'm going to

write a screenplay

three screenplays this year three

different genres that's a plan

can you do that while you have your day

job sure you can so i think it's a

matter of really

being realistic about not just what the

dream is

but what how you envision you might get

there

chances are it won't work exactly that

way but chances are if you have that

vision

you're going to come somewhat close or

at least be moving in that direction

are you almost relieved that

you didn't take a day job

you know you said you would work at one

directing thing or something

then as many industry jobs

another one um but if you

had had something more cush or that it

was just more stable

then you wouldn't have created what

you've created more push or stable like

what

well if if you just had like this steady

job after job you said sometimes you

you waited and you relied too much on a

job being there for you

and and maybe it wasn't at times maybe

that was a painful lesson

um do you think that in some ways that

was a good painful lesson because then

it

ignited in you to start you know what

you started and

write and do these classes and and the

travis institute and all these different

things

yeah it's i mean it did the everything

i'm doing now that elsa and i are doing

now together which started many many

years ago

was generated was started out of that

desperation

out of that desperation i have to do

something

and because of who i am or whatever my

personality what i did not pursue

was a typical day job

whether it's waiting on tables or

working for a

company or something like that my

fallback has always been create

something

so i would create a job and that was

creating workshops that i was teaching

first for actors and then for directors

i would keep creating something that

didn't exist

that i could do which would keep me

close to what i was doing anyway i

didn't want to go and work

in you know nine to five in some you

know office building i just

that would be just too devastating to me

too demoralizing for me

so that's what i would do but i would

wait a long time

before doing that until it was desperate

and then i would have to

put something together rather quickly to

keep everything going then ironically

with the teaching

that i was doing it became

more than just a day job it became an

entire business

became an entire business that you know

resulted in what i'm doing now which is

traveling around the world

and teaching and many times i go what

what happened to my other job

the directing thing all the other stuff

i was doing because this has become

um so you know

massive of what i'm doing and now with

elsa what

else and i are doing together that

it has taken over and sometimes i i

think what would happen

what would happen now if i was offered a

directing thing

like well we'd have to make some big

shifts and changes

so but that and that's okay but that

that's the way my life has always been

it's always been

um a bit chaotic

and under my control which means

sometimes out of control

but at the end of the day you're still

working with story

still doing this that's something you

love yeah yeah i

if well if you're going to create

something you might as well create

something you enjoy doing so i wouldn't

create something i enjoy doing

or that i knew i was good at and that i

could

survive at if i could just construct

something

[Music]

um along the lines so the teaching and

the coaching

and the consulting and all of that falls

right in that although it's not

directing but

you know it's all around it is and all

my

directing skills and my writing skills

you know

um supply that support that

that process so i'm not that far away

from what i was doing in fact i've moved

way beyond what i was

doing so again going back to when should

an artist create uh

when should an artist quit their day job

it's when it becomes unbearable

at that day john unbearable

or their other thing becomes undeniable

in terms of supporting them

unbearable undeniable

yeah um yeah it's it's sort of in that

zone the reason i'm hesitating is

because i just remembered something

um that happened to me they were again

doing a lot of the teaching stuff there

was a time this was back in the early

90s

and i was teaching a lot of workshops

and

um doing

you know doing what i was doing teaching

workshops and and trying to get

directing jobs and

through a series of circumstances which

are not

important right at the moment i got a

job

directing a feature film for warner

brothers okay

and there was a long story on how that

all happened that's not important

and i the important part is okay now i'm

directing this

film it's a low budget film but it's for

a major studio and i'm getting all the

studio support and everything's going

fine

and i'm still doing in my other i'm

still running workshops i'm doing

everything else i was and i'm used to

doing 12 things at the same time

anyway and that's what my life was like

and i would have clients i would work

with

and i remember one meeting and we're

going into pre-production where the

producers from warner brothers

sat me down and said ah mark

you have to stop doing these other

things

i go why you know one workshop was on

wednesday evening

i'll be free on wednesday evenings the

other ones i could do on weekends i'm

free on weekends

no no no mark you have to you're

directing this

film yeah you had that has to be your

sole focus

and i remember resenting that going why

i don't want to do that

i want to do these other things too and

ironically

i did shut down all the other things but

the irony is

now we're deep into pre-production and

i'm we're working monday through friday

and i have a stu

at the studio and i have my office and

we're setting everything up

and i remember hitting the first weekend

and everybody said okay it's friday okay

see you on monday i go

monday well what are we doing saturday

and sunday

nothing well what am i gonna do saturday

and sunday

i was so used to working seven days a

week

doing something every single day now i'd

shut down all the other stuff

and now i didn't have that other thing

so i had to make a whole

shift in my way of approaching the work

i mean it was absolutely right

you know i needed to totally focus on

the film

and i and i did and all that but that

was a shift so i think for anybody

considering

making that kind of change think about

what you're used to and what your

patterns are and what you can handle and

what you can't

handle and what the day job is and my

feeling is if you get to the point you

say i better quit the day job because

this other stuff that i'm doing

which is my dream is

demanding so much of my time and

attention and i say well

then it's time to quit it's time to quit

what did you end up doing for the first

few saturdays and sundays

of that directing job it was it was hard

it was it was really hard because there

was nobody in the office

nobody i could talk to you know i'd go

back and i'd read the script again and

i'd make

notes and i would do do my own research

or planning

but i'm the type of artist who loves to

collaborate i love other people being

around

so i love being at the studio i love

working with the designers i love

working with the casting director i

loved working with all these people and

suddenly you leave me for two days and

nobody to talk to

and i felt lost

and i was like we could be home with my

family that's fine but

i wanted to do i wanted to i really

literally i think at that time wanted to

why can't we work through the weekend

too

why do we have to stop for the weekend

but that's just my personality

it's a great story yeah

oh i like that

so then when that job was over you knew

was that was that your

your test well when when ironically when

that job was over

and now i had a terrific agency not an

agent but an agency working for me and i

was reading a lot of scripts because i

was directing of

a studio picture and um

scripts were being sent to me to see if

i was interested in it

and all of this the other thing and

i was trying the the goal now is to set

up the next project

because this project is coming near an

end set up the next project

and i r without i can't mention the

agencies and all that right

um my agent big agency

said you know i said let's set up the

next project and they said to me

the agency said to me uh well let's see

how this movie does first

and i'll never forget this and i was

sitting there

and there were inquiries from other

studios about

things and i said well can we set

something let's see how this film does

first and i knew at that moment

because we're near we're near the end of

post-production

that the film was not going to do well

for a lot of reasons

i knew that it's not it's not going to

be like wow let's hire this guy

even though the reactions to the footage

and the reactions to the performances

all were great and everything i

said this is not going to do well and i

knew why

and i said to the agent i said listen

if the film does really well i don't

need you

if it doesn't do well you can't help me

i said we have to do it now and they

said no and i knew that that was the end

of my relationship with that agency and

it was i switched agents

but the film did not do well i did not

get another

job set up and i was doing fine because

the film paid well

but then that's only going to last so

long and it was months later

still trying to set up the next job that

i realized

i have to do something to generate

income

i can't go back and do theater now

because it'll take me too long to set up

a play that i'm going to direct

at a local theater i can't go back to

television because i've been out of

television for too long and it's going

to take time

i need in other words i need income now

and so i started teaching and that's

when

that was the beginning of the whole

teaching thing that has led to where i

am now

and then in between you've written two

books

written two books and there's another

one in the works

which will be done someday yep

that's a great story i'm sure it's a

painful one at that time yeah

oh yeah that's a great story it's very

painful to be

um i'll tell you one thing it's very

painful at that studio

which is a big studio and we were

shooting

on a lot that was not at that studio so

the times i would go to that studio

and people would see me while we were

shooting come on i love you phil love

your deal

i go to your dailies every day and this

is these are people who

are not working on the film they're just

at the studio they would just go to see

the stuff that we

shot so you have all that

that um

that build up that sort of support and

feeling like wow i'm

i'm doing well i'm doing well here all

of that and then during post-production

which is i could tell you this whole

story of post-production and how it all

slowly fell apart um

sometimes because of distrust sometimes

because of sabotage by other people

and sometimes because of infighting

inside the studio because there were

studio executives who wanted the film to

fail

and i ran into it and at the very end

of that whole journey with that studio

i was asked to meet with the head of the

studio

he was a sweet guy nice guy we had a

long talk about

and he said mark you were just in the

wrong place

at the wrong time

i go well that doesn't help me at all

so it was very it was very painful when

you think okay

now the career is starting to move now

i'm moving and now i'm doing well and

now they like the work

they like me and all that but

what is the truth behind the lie the

truth behind the lie

okay in um autobiographical storytelling

one thing we're very strict about to a

point

is we are telling the true story we're

sticking to the truth we're sticking to

the truth of characters

sticking to the truth of events we're

not

making up stuff and

but there are times when

we actually fictionalize the truth

fictionalize the truth in other words

lie to get closer to a deeper truth

in other words um

i'll give you an example when i was

developing um a bronx

tale and a bronx tale is about

yonkologio

and his father and the gangster

uh sonny and i said

to chaz i need a story

about your father you know and we need

some kind of story or event with your

father

that actually shows how he is

dealing with the conflict between

you that you have with this gangster

and how he's dealing with the gangster

and he says well there isn't any story

there isn't any story like that there

isn't any event

he said you know when they got together

or there

where he confronted the boy about it i

said well then we have to create one

and what we did is we created a story

so we could get closer to the truth of

how the father

felt about this chaz knew how he felt

about it but by creating a story

that really didn't happen any scene that

didn't happen

and in the film and in the play there

these scenes are still there

these scenes are still there that didn't

actually happen because they're

there to serve a purpose and the purpose

of these these

fictional scenes are these fictional

exchanges and sometimes

it even comes down to we will put words

in a character's mouth that they never

said

but those words reveal the truth of the

character we will

that's when we will fictionalize to get

closer to a truth

and that's allowed how do writers feel

about that

about the way well you talk about the

autobiographical part now sure

first of all the writer is the character

who lived through

this uh usually they feel fine about it

because many times i'll say okay in this

situation if your

father said this um let's say it's

the little boy this is not from the

bronx deal little boy the father and the

mother

and let's say there's an argument going

on between the little boy

and the father i said okay what what

happens if

if the mother was in that scene or heard

that scene what would she have said

oh it would have been awful really what

would she have said

and he would tell me that she would said

something like that um

give me an idea what she would said she

would have been horrified and furious

say fine let's put her in the scene

but she wasn't in the scene i know she

wasn't in the scene

but we're trying to get closer to what

the dynamics are in this relationship

and if we put her in the scene some so

many times we'll try we'll experiment

we'll rehearse

put her in the scene and have her say

that many times the writer getting back

to your question will go

that's no that's good that's good that's

what would have happened that's who they

are

and if i can if i can get to that point

where the writers say that's

really who they are that's the truth of

who they are

then i feel fine and they feel fine they

feel good because they've been

they've honored the truth of the

characters maybe not the truth of the

events

what is the gap the gap the gap

the gap not the store and not like

not a gas store but i like the t-shirt i

like the not only the tea i used to have

a t-shirt

but i like in london you know at the

tube mind

the gap oh when i when i started to

realize something very important this is

a long time ago when i was doing these

autobiographical pieces and i was

working on

one or two of them i forget which one

doesn't matter

when i realized that i knew what the

events were i knew what happened

they told me this is what happened what

happened and what happened

but then i realized that something was

missing in the telling of the story

and what was missing

was from the protagonist the main

character

the autobiographical character i wasn't

hearing what

they really wanted to have happen were

hoping would happen

and expecting to happen

in other words if it's if it's a

confrontation

let's make it very simple it's a guy

telling the story

and it's a story about him asking

um a beautiful young woman

to go to the prom with him and he tells

me what happens and what she said

and i realized what is missing in that

story is what he

thought was going to happen what he

hoped would happen what he

fantasized would happen now in other

words his pursuit is to ask

her to the prom and want and he wants

her to say yes

okay prior to

telling the whole story he need we need

to know what he thinks is going to

happen

how he's going to pursue that so that we

are riding with that character inside

his belief

inside his expectation inside his desire

so we are writing with him if we

if he leaves that out he just says i'm

going to ask her out and we don't know

how important this is we don't know

what's riding on it

we don't know what he's expecting if she

says yes we don't know what he's

expecting if he says no if we don't know

that

half of the scene is gone half of the

energy is gone

so what will happen what i realized when

i

started exploring this is this is the

way we all

go through life we all go

through life no different than this

interview all of us in this room the

four of us in this room

had an expectation of how this interview

would turn out

and i can tell you right now we are all

wrong

it has turned out differently

that's all just different it's

just different so if we

look at life as we move through life we

move through life we have a pursuit this

is what we're going to do

we talk about going to lunch i'm going

to have this meal immediately i'll have

ideas about what i think it's going to

be like and then i have to deal with

life as it happens which means it's

going to be

different the thing you want to order

will not be on the menu the

restaurant will not look like you want

to want to you have to serve yourself

well yeah

there's no way to whatever things are

different so the

gap put it in the simplest of terms

is expectation versus

result what does the character

expect and then what is the result

and how is that different and the truth

is we all

live with the gap every single day

every single day as part of our daily

experience this this is what's going to

happen all of us in this room now

because we're in the middle of the

afternoon have an expectation of what

is going to happen the rest of the day i

can tell you right now it won't work out

the way you think it's going to

something different will happen and

that's life so i realized in

constructing these stories

these autobiographical stories i needed

to

expose to the audience through the

storyteller

what the character wants and needs and

why it's so important

and what they are expecting very

specifically

with that naive narrator talking to the

audience saying

i'm going to go ask her for the date

it's going to be great it's going to be

great because she's not going to expect

that i'm going to ask her at all

and she's going to be so thrilled

because she i know she likes me

now i'm just giving you a lot of

information as what this character is

imagining and dreaming will happen and

then as that story goes along and it

gets to the point of

asking her and he gets to the point of

saying

i do you want to go to the are you going

to go to the prom she says oh yes i am

oh great um

you want to go with me now we're at that

point where he thinks

she's going to be thrilled

and what does she say why would i do

that

now big gap right there why would now

if we don't know how much he's invested

in this that response will mean

less we have to be

we have to be carrying his investment

into the scene with him

and so that we are hit by those

obstacles

as he navigates through that scene

it reminds me i had a college professor

that wrote on the chalkboard

expectations equals

disappointments now that sounds a little

negative

but i think in some ways if you yeah if

you approach it like that

then maybe you wouldn't get your hopes

dashed yeah

i thought that was really interesting i

know i i worked somewhere and i put that

up and so i said oh that's so negative

and i thought well actually it's more of

a realist

yeah or think of it this way flip it

around

imagine karen that you have expectations

for something

what's what's going on something you

want something you're going to do a

pursuit

and maybe it's the simplest thing of um

i'll make it very simple your ex you're

going to cook a meal

for you and david you're going to cook

this okay that's a meal you've never

cooked before

you have the recipe you have all the

ingredients your expectations is going

to be fantastic it's going to be gourmet

yeah

it's going to be gourmet right okay and

you make the whole thing and it's all

and it looks good and it smells good and

you serve it and it is gourmet and it's

exactly what you wanted

is that interesting now

the thing is if the if we always get the

expectations or if our characters always

get what they expect

it's not an interesting story because it

has no relationship

to life that's true it's too perfect

it's too planned

it probably wouldn't happen

but the thing is if you're fixing this

gourmet meal and it looks good and

smells good you know and david's coming

home and he comes home with kentucky

fried chicken

hey i got dinner now there's a gap

there is right now there's a gap and he

goes oh now

disappointment right see in other words

i think that disappointment thing is

very accurate

and that's what we live with every day

it's not a negative it's a reality

things do not turn out and it doesn't

mean things are worse

it just means they're different it could

be better a gap as things turn out even

better very true if you were making that

gourmet meal and you're going this

why am i doing this and this now your

expectation is going to be a disaster

because you've never made it before and

you don't have quite the right

ingredients

and you're using olives instead of

grapes or something and

and it turns out wonderful well there's

a gap

that's true a good good uh different

yeah expectations yeah

those disappointments so that's the gap

it's very important

in not just autobiographical but i think

in any

to me as i look at screenplays and stuff

like that every scene

there's a gap right sometimes line to

line there's a gap

someone asks a question do you want to

go out tonight

the answer is where did you put the

cheese

there's a gap do you want to go out

tonight i'm expecting an answer

i didn't get an answer i got a question

about where's the cheese

in fact i never get to ask that question

so those are little gaps

life goes like that we keep sort of

navigating and working our way finding

our way through a world that won't

give us exactly what we want because

that's just the way it works
